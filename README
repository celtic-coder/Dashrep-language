Language::Dashrep

Dashrep is a versatile descriptive programming language based on hyphenated phrases (such as "rectangle-outline-attention-begin") being successively expanded into replacement text.  The resulting expanded text can be an HTML web page, an XML file, a JavaScript program, a boilerplate-based document, etc.  It is a much more flexible alternative to using a template language, yet it is much more useful than simply being a text-manipulation language.

See www.Dashrep.org for details.

The Dashrep compiler is written in the Dashrep language.  The current implementation of this compiler generates Perl code that is directly executable as Perl code.  In the future the runtime language is expected to be changed to a combination of C and C++ code that is compiled by the Clang compiler.
