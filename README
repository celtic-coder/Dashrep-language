Language::Dashrep

Dashrep is a programming language that is simple, powerful, and fast.

See www.Dashrep.org for details.

The Dashrep compiler is written in the Dashrep language.

The current implementation of the Dashrep compiler generates Perl code that is directly executable as Perl code.  In the future the runtime code will be changed to a combination of C and C++ code that is compiled by the Clang compiler.

Version 3.03


RUNNING

These instructions explain how to run the Dashrep compiler, and the compiled program, in the Windows environment.

Use these commands to prepare to use the Perl "interpreter."  Replace the "whatever" string as needed.

    set PerlPath=C:\whatever\
    set PERL5LIB=C:\whatever\

Verify that the needed files are available.

    dir %PerlPath%perl.exe
    dir %PerlPath%perl512.dll
    dir dashrep_compiler_executable.pl
    dir input_dashrep_dolphin_talkative.txt

Compile the "..._dolphin_talkative" sample Dashrep code.

    del input_to_dashrep_compiler.txt
    copy input_dashrep_dolphin_talkative.txt input_to_dashrep_compiler.txt
    del output_trace.txt
    %PerlPath%perl -w dashrep_compiler_executable.pl > output_piped_results_from_compiling_dashrep_dolphin_talkative.txt
    del output_dashrep_dolphin_talkative.pl
    rename output_from_dashrep_compiler.txt output_dashrep_dolphin_talkative.pl

(Note: The above code will be simplified when the Dashrep compiler gets an action that reads from standard input.)

Run the compiled program.

    %PerlPath%perl output_dashrep_dolphin_talkative.pl > output_piped_results_from_dashrep_dolphin_talkative.txt

To fully test the compiler, use the code above but replace "input_dashrep_dolphin_talkative.txt" with "dashrep_test_code_joined_dashdefs.txt" and adjust the output filenames as desired.  Some tests that expect specific environments (specifically "cgi" and "curl") may fail, even though the compiler is working correctly.
