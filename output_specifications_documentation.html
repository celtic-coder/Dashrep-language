<tr><th>Normal <br \> priority</th><th>Name</th><th>Appearance</th><th>Description</th></tr>
<tr><td>1</td><td>Comment</td><td><b><i>*---&nbsp;</i></b> comment here &nbsp; <b><i>---*</i></b></td><td>Comments are ignored.&nbsp; The text <b><i>*---</i></b> indicates the beginning of a comment, and the text <b><i>---*</i></b> indicates the end of the comment.&nbsp; Comments cannot be nested; if they are, the results are unpredictable.&nbsp; The comment directives are not recognized if they appear within parameter brackets.</td></tr>
<tr><td>1</td><td>Comment</td><td><b><i>/---&nbsp;</i></b> comment here &nbsp; <b><i>---/</i></b></td><td>Alternate written way to indicate a comment.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Comment</td><td><b><i>comment-begin</i></b> comment here <b><i>comment-end</i></b></td><td>An alternate way &mdash; that is speakable &mdash; to insert a comment.&nbsp; The <b><i>comment-begin</i></b> phrase indicates the beginning of a comment, and the <b><i>comment-end</i></b> phrase indicates the end of the comment.&nbsp; Comments cannot be nested.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Space</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td>Each space is significant as a delimiter for hyphenated phrases and words (without hyphens).</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Three or more adjacent hyphens</td><td><b><i>----</i></b></td><td>Indicates the end of a definition, in a situation where a hyphenated phrase is defined using the <b><i>dashrep-definitions-begin</i></b> directive (or the equivalent).</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Parameter</td><td><b><i>[-</i></b> &nbsp; parameter &nbsp; <b><i>-]</i></b></td><td>A parameter is expanded before the surrounding text is expanded.&nbsp; The first-encountered innermost parameter is expanded first.&nbsp; Spaces at the beginning and end of the parameter are removed, which allows the expanded text to become part of a hyphenated phrase, which in turn enables branching and indexing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Phrase name in parameter brackets</td><td><b><i>[-</i></b> user-phrase-name <b><i>-]</i></b></td><td>A hyphenated phrase within parameter brackets is expanded according to the phrase's definition (which itself can contain parameters).&nbsp; If the phrase name is not defined, it is left as-is, and the parameter brackets are removed.&nbsp; Spaces at the beginning and end of the parameter are removed, which allows the expanded text to become part of a hyphenated phrase, which in turn enables branching and indexing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Action</td><td><b><i>[-</i></b> zero-one-multiple 3 <b><i>-]</i></b></td><td>If the first (left-most) hyphenated phrase inside a parameter is one of the recognized actions (listed below), and the action is followed by text that the action knows how to handle, the action is performed.&nbsp; Some actions produce text that becomes the replacement for the parameter, whereas other actions operate on phrases or files and do not produce any text.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Hyphenated phrase</td><td>needed-text-string</td><td>A hyphen surrounded by non-space characters (and also excluding square brackets) is recognized as a hyphenated phrase.&nbsp; (A hyphen and a dash are different names for the same symbol.)&nbsp; A phrase name is case-sensitive.&nbsp; Lowercase-only names are recommended, but not required.&nbsp; Speakable names are recommended, but not required.&nbsp; The use of nouns before, rather than after, adjectives is recommended; this convention (for example <b><i>rectangle-large-begin</i></b> instead of <b><i>large-rectangle-begin</i></b>) is typical of many spoken languages, but not English.&nbsp; The first character cannot be a hyphen and cannot be a digit.&nbsp; The last character cannot be a hyphen.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Colon</td><td>needed-text-string<b><i>:</i></b> definition here &nbsp; <b><i>----</i></b></td><td>When there is text after the <b><i>dashrep-definitions-begin</i></b> directive, a colon can appear at the end of the phrase being defined.&nbsp; This convention is optional.&nbsp; It offers the advantage of making it easier to search for where a hyphenated phrase is defined, without also finding each place it is used.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>New line or line break</td><td>one line <b><i>line-break</i></b> next line</td><td>When a new line begins, it is replaced with a space.&nbsp; When a new line needs to be inserted into the resulting text, the new-line phrase (explained below) can be used.&nbsp; If a line break in the target language (such as HTML) is needed, the phrase line-break can be used to insert the appropriate target-specific code (which in HTML is the <b><i><br \></i></b> tag).</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Undefined hyphenated phrase</td><td>quite-talkative parrot</td><td>If a hyphenated phrase has not been defined, it is not translated; it remains unchanged.&nbsp; If a hyphenated phrase has been defined and is now empty, the hyphenated phrase will disapper.</td></tr>

<h2> Directives versus actions versus phrases </h2> <h3> Phrase </h3> <p> A <b>phrase</b> is a hyphenated phrase that has a definition, and the definition is inserted in place of the hyphenated phrase.&nbsp; Phrases are recognized regardless of whether or not they appear within parameter brackets. </p> <h3> Directive </h3> <p> A <b>directive</b> is a hyphenated phrase that triggers a special functionality in the translation.&nbsp; Directives are not recognized if they appear within parameter brackets. </p> <h3> Action </h3> <p> An <b>action</b> is a hyphenated phrase that has special significance when it appears at the beginning of text that is enclosed by parameter brackets.&nbsp; An action is not recognized if it is not within parameter brackets, or if it is not the first hyphenated phrase in the parameter brackets. </p><h2>Hyphens, spaces, lines, & square brackets</h2>


<h3 id="hyphen-here">hyphen-here</h3>
<p>This directive inserts a hyphen, with no adjacent spaces, where it appears within text that is expanded (translated).&nbsp; Internally this phrase is defined as <b><i>no-space - no-space</i></b>.</p>


<h3 id="character-hyphen">character-hyphen</h3>
<p>This pre-defined phrase contains one hyphen character (<b><i>-</i></b>).</p>


<h3 id="four-hyphens">four-hyphens</h3>
<p>This pre-defined phrase contains four adjacent hyphen characters (<b><i>----</i></b>).</p>


<h3 id="no-space">no-space</h3>
<p>This directive removes any spaces (concatenation) after all other phrases have been replaced (during expansion).&nbsp; If the <b><i>one-space</i></b> directive is adjacent, the <b><i>no-space</i></b> directive is ignored.</p>


<h3 id="empty-text">empty-text</h3>
<p>This pre-defined phrase contains no text.&nbsp; To clear a phrase, use the action <b><i>clear-phrase</i></b>.&nbsp; To test whether a phrase's definition is empty, use the action <b><i>yes-or-no-empty-phrase</i></b>.</p>


<h3 id="one-space">one-space</h3>
<p>This directive inserts a single space.&nbsp; If the <b><i>no-space</i></b> directive is adjacent, the <b><i>no-space</i></b> directive is ignored.&nbsp; Repeating this directive does not insert multiple adjacent spaces, just a single space.&nbsp; If multiple spaces are needed, a phrase such as <b><i>four-spaces</i></b> can be defined as multiple spaces, and then those spaces will be inserted where the text <b><i><four_spaces></i></b> appears.</p>


<h3 id="character-space">character-space</h3>
<p>This pre-defined phrase contains one space character.</p>


<h3 id="non-breaking-space">non-breaking-space</h3>
<p>This directive inserts a non-breaking space where it is encountered within text that is expanded.&nbsp; This text is inserted even if the <b><i>no-space</i></b> directive is adjacent.&nbsp; The default value that is inserted, which is intended for use in HTML, is <b><i>&amp;nbsp;</i></b>.</p>


<h3 id="new-line">new-line</h3>
<p>This directive inserts a <b><i>newline</i></b> character, which specifies the start of a new line.&nbsp; If the target language, such as HTML, ignores line breaks, the line break will not be visible in the displayed result.</p>


<h3 id="empty-line">empty-line</h3>
<p>This directive specifies an empty line, which is equivalent to two adjacent <b><i>new-line</i></b> directives.</p>


<h3 id="line-break">line-break</h3>
<p>This phrase should be defined as text that, in turn, specifies a line break in the target language. </p> <p> Example: If the target language is HTML, normally this phrase would be defined as <b><i>&lt;br&nbsp;/&gt;</i></b>.</p>


<h3 id="character-newline">character-newline</h3>
<p>This pre-defined phrase contains a newline character.&nbsp; In some other programming languages this character is represented by the text <b>\<i>n</i></b>.</p>


<h3 id="character-open-square-bracket">character-open-square-bracket</h3>
<p>This pre-defined phrase contains the open-square-bracket character (<b>[</b>).</p>


<h3 id="character-close-square-bracket">character-close-square-bracket</h3>
<p>This pre-defined phrase contains the close-square-bracket character (<b>]</b>).</p>


<h3 id="character-tab">character-tab</h3>
<p>This pre-defined phrase contains a tab character.&nbsp; In some other programming languages this character is represented by the text <b>\<i>t</i></b>.</p>


<h3 id="delayed-nospace">delayed-nospace</h3>
<p>This phrase is not defined, but this name is reserved for use as a placeholder where the phrase <b><i>no-space</i></b> needs to be inserted later, after other replacements have been done.&nbsp; When ready, this phrase should be defined as <b><i>no-space</i></b> just before the final translation step.</p>


<h3 id="delayed-newline">delayed-newline</h3>
<p>This phrase is not defined, but this name is reserved for use as a placeholder where the phrase <b><i>new-line</i></b> needs to be inserted later, after other replacements have been done.&nbsp; When ready, this phrase should be defined as <b><i>new-line</i></b> just before the final translation step.</p>


<h2>Expansion-related phrases</h2>


<h3 id="expand-text">expand-text</h3>
<p>This action expands ("translates") the contents of the first phrase and puts the results into the second phrase.&nbsp; This action provides a way to separately expand the same phrase repeatedly, such as for generating multiple items that will appear in different table cells, and for expanding the same file-path template to point to different file paths.&nbsp; If the name of the phrase that needs to be expanded can change, then the first phrase can be surrounded with ambee and amenn delimiters.&nbsp; If needed, the expanded result can be inserted inline (into the code that contains this action) by following this action with the expanded phrase name (without surrounding am-bee and am-enn delimiters).&nbsp; The first phrase name and the second phrase name can be the same (without automatically causing an endless loop). </p> <p> In addition to replacing hyphenated phrase names with their associated definitions, the expansion also replaces each occurrence of a specially identified hyphenated phrase with the definition of that phrase.&nbsp; The specially identified hyphenated phrases begin and end with angle brackets (<b><i>&lt;</i></b> and <b><i>&gt;</i></b>) and contain at least one underscore (<b><i>_</i></b>), such as <b><i>&lt;special_content&gt;</i></b>.&nbsp; For each such specially identified hyphenated phrase, the underscores are (internally) replaced with hyphens, and if the resulting hyphenated phrase has a definition, then that definition is inserted in place of the specially identified hyphenated phrase (but the underscores are not changed if there is no associated phrase).&nbsp; The special text <b><i>&lt;character_hyphen&gt;</i></b> is replaced by a hyphen (<b><i>-</i></b>) and is especially useful for handling text that contains Dashrep phrases that must not be replaced.&nbsp; The special text items <b><i>&lt;no_space&gt;</i></b> and <b><i>&lt;new_line&gt;</i></b> provide functionality that is equivalent to the <b><i>no-space</i></b> and <b><i>new-line</i></b> directives. </p> <p> This action does the same translation of Dashrep text as the default expansion of Dashrep text, so this action is usually only needed for complex expansions of Dashrep code.</p>


<h2>Text-transfer-related phrases</h2>


<h3 id="copy-text">copy-text</h3>
<p>This action copies the definition of the first hyphenated phrase into the definition of the second hyphenated phrase.&nbsp; This action must be followed by two phrase names, not one.&nbsp; The previous definition of the second hyphenated phrase is deleted.</p>


<h3 id="put-into-phrase">put-into-phrase</h3>
<p>This action copies into the first hyphenated phrase the text that follows the first hyphenated phrase, up to the end of the parameter brackets.&nbsp; The text can contain hyphens if they are not adjacent to an open angle bracket or close angle bracket.&nbsp; Trailing spaces and trailing hyphens are ignored. </p> <p> Example: After expanding the code <b><i>ambee put-into-phrase target-phrase whale dolphin starfish amenn</i></b> the phrase <b><i>target-phrase</i></b> will contain <b><i>whale dolphin starfish</i></b>.</p>


<h3 id="copy-listed-words-to-phrases-named-in-pattern">copy-listed-words-to-phrases-named-in-pattern</h3>
<p>This action copies multiple phrase definitions.&nbsp; Specifically space-delimited words in the first phrase are copied to multiple phrase names, where the phrase names have the pattern specified in the second phrase.&nbsp; The pattern must contain characters between the text <b><i>ambee-</i></b> (or <b><i>fenambee-</i></b>) and the text <b><i>-amenn</i></b> (or <b><i>amennfen-</i></b>), and these characters must be the name of a phrase that contains the space-delimited words that will be inserted at that position within the pattern.&nbsp; If the phrase that contains the target word list contains only a single word without any spaces, then only one item will be copied.&nbsp; If the list is empty, nothing will be copied.&nbsp; If the number of words in the first phrase is different from the number of words in the list that is specified within the pattern, the copying will stop when the shorter list is exhausted.&nbsp; This action is useful for copying a long list fast, without needing to use a separate Dashrep action for each item copied. </p> <p> Example: If the first phrase contains <b><i>dolphin buffalo bear</i></b>, and the second phrase contains <b><i>item-ambee-list-of-numbers-as-text-amenn</i></b>, and the phrase <b><i>list-of-numbers-as-text</i></b> contains the text <b><i>one two three</i></b>, then the phrase <b><i>item-one</i></b> will contain <b><i>dolphin</i></b> and the phrase <b><i>item-two</i></b> will contain <b><i>buffalo</i></b> and the phrase <b><i>item-three</i></b> will contain <b><i>bear</i></b>.</p>


<h3 id="append-text">append-text</h3>
<p>This action appends the definition of the first phrase to the end of the definition of the second phrase, and inserts a single space between the existing text and the appended text.&nbsp; The two phrase names can be the same.&nbsp; If the target phrase is initially empty, the space is not inserted.</p>


<h3 id="append-text-no-space">append-text-no-space</h3>
<p>This action appends the definition of the first phrase to the end of the definition of the second phrase, without inserting a separating space, and without removing any adjacent trailing spaces (in the second phrase definition) or leading spaces (in the first phrase definition).&nbsp; The two phrase names can be the same.</p>


<h3 id="append-new-line">append-new-line</h3>
<p>This action appends a newline code to the end of a definition.</p>


<h3 id="append-repeatedly-using-count">append-repeatedly-using-count</h3>
<p>This action repeatedly appends the definition of the first hyphenated phrase to the end of the definition of the second hyphenated phrase, until the number of copies specified in the third operand have been inserted.&nbsp; Spaces separate the appended text items.&nbsp; This action must be followed by two phrase names and a positive integer number.&nbsp; This action avoids complications that can arise if the text being copied should not be expanded, and is much faster than using the <b><i>use-handler-with-each-word-in-phrase</i></b>.</p>


<h3 id="append-multiple-from-phrases-named-in-pattern">append-multiple-from-phrases-named-in-pattern</h3>
<p>This action appends multiple phrase definitions onto the end of the definition of the second phrase.&nbsp; The pattern for the multiple phrase names is specified in the first phrase.&nbsp; The pattern must contain characters between the text <b><i>ambee-</i></b> and the text <b><i>-amenn</i></b>, and these characters must be the name of a phrase that contains the space-delimited words that will be inserted at that position within the pattern.&nbsp; (Although <b><i>fenambee</i></b> or <b><i>amennfen</i></b> might normally be used to indicate the inclusion of a hyphen, they are not recognized by this action.)&nbsp; If the phrase that contains the word list contains only a single word without any spaces, then only one item will be appended.&nbsp; If the list is empty, nothing will be appended.&nbsp; This action is useful for building a long list fast, without needing to use a separate Dashrep action for each item appended. </p> <p> Example:&nbsp; If the first phrase contains the text <b><i>item-ambee-list-of-numbers-as-text-amenn</i></b> and the phrase <b><i>list-of-numbers-as-text</i></b> contains the text <b><i>one two three</i></b> and the second phrase already contains the text <b><i>dolphin</i></b> and the phrase <b><i>item-one</i></b> contains <b><i>buffalo</i></b> and the phrase <b><i>item-two</i></b> contains <b><i>bear</i></b> and the phrase <b><i>item-three</i></b> contains <b><i>eagle</i></b> then the second phrase will contain <b><i>dolphin buffalo bear eagle</i></b>.</p>


<h3 id="prepend-text">prepend-text</h3>
<p>This action prepends the definition of the first phrase into the beginning of the definition of the second phrase, without inserting a separating space.&nbsp; If the target phrase is initially empty, the space is not inserted.</p>


<h3 id="prepend-text-no-space">prepend-text-no-space</h3>
<p>This action prepends the definition of the first phrase into the beginning of the definition of the second phrase, and inserts a single space between the prepended text and the existing text.</p>


<h2>Clear & delete phrases</h2>


<h3 id="clear-phrase">clear-phrase</h3>
<p>This action clears the definition for the specified phrase.&nbsp; The specified phrase continues to be defined, but the definition is empty.</p>


<h3 id="clear-listed-phrases">clear-listed-phrases</h3>
<p>This action clears the definitions for the phrases that are named in the specified phrase.&nbsp; The phrases continue to exist, but their definitions are empty.</p>


<h3 id="delete-listed-phrases">delete-listed-phrases</h3>
<p>This action deletes (removes) the phrases that are named in the specified phrase.&nbsp; This phrase is related to the action <b><i>clear-listed-phrases</i></b> except that instead of just clearing the definition, this delete version removes (deletes) the phrase so that it will not be recognized.&nbsp; This action is useful when the text being expanded contains phrases that should remain in the text if they are not defined, instead of being replaced by their empty definitions.</p>


<h2>Decision-related phrases</h2>


<h3 id="if-yes-begin">if-yes-begin</h3>
<p>This action looks at the first space-delimited word, and if it is <b><i>yes</i></b> (or contains that word) then this action removes all the text between the next occurrences of <b><i>[-if-else-]</i></b> and <b><i>[-if-end-]</i></b> (and removes the <b><i>[-if-else-]</i></b> and <b><i>[-if-end-]</i></b> text items).&nbsp; Otherwise (if the first word that follows does not contain <b><i>yes</i></b>) then this action removes all the text between itself (the action name) and the next occurrence of <b><i>[-if-else-]</i></b> (and removes the <b><i>[-if-else-]</i></b> and <b><i>[-if-end-]</i></b> text items).&nbsp; This action provides a major branching capability.&nbsp; However, the action <b><i>if-yes-begin</i></b> and the text <b><i>[-if-else-]</i></b> and the text <b><i>[-if-end-]</i></b> <b>cannot</b> be nested (as allowed in most programming languages).&nbsp; Specifically, an inner <b><i>if</i></b> action must not appear within an outer <b><i>if</i></b> action within the same Dashrep code.&nbsp; The functional nesting of <b><i>if</i></b> branches is allowed if the inner <b><i>if</i></b> action appears within a separate phrase that is not expanded until after the outer <b><i>if</i></b> directive is handled.</p>


<h3 id="if-no-begin">if-no-begin</h3>
<p>This action works similar to the action <b><i>if-yes-begin</i></b> except that the word <b><i>no</i></b> is used instead of the word <b><i>yes</i></b>.</p>


<h3 id="if-else">if-else</h3>
<p>This special text is recognized by the action <b><i>if-yes-begin</i></b> and the action <b><i>if-no-begin</i></b>.&nbsp; It must be enclosed by parameter brackets in order to be recognized.</p>


<h3 id="if-end">if-end</h3>
<p>This special text is recognized by the action <b><i>if-yes-begin</i></b> and the action <b><i>if-no-begin</i></b>.&nbsp; It must be enclosed by parameter brackets in order to be recognized.</p>


<h3 id="yes-or-no-empty-phrase">yes-or-no-empty-phrase</h3>
<p>This action supplies <b><i>yes</i></b> if the following specified phrase is empty, and supplies <b><i>no</i></b> otherwise.&nbsp; A phrase is empty if it contains nothing, or if it contains only spaces, or if it has not yet been defined.&nbsp; If no operand is supplied (which occurs if the intended operand is a parameter phrase that supplies no text), then this action supplies <b><i>yes</i></b>.</p>


<h3 id="yes-or-no-same-two-phrase-definitions">yes-or-no-same-two-phrase-definitions</h3>
<p>This action supplies <b><i>yes</i></b> if the following two phrase contain the same text, and supplies <b><i>no</i></b> otherwise.</p>


<h3 id="yes-or-no-same-two-words">yes-or-no-same-two-words</h3>
<p>This action supplies <b><i>yes</i></b> if the following two space-delimited words are the same, and supplies <b><i>no</i></b> otherwise. If only one word is supplied, or if no word is supplied, then this action supplies <b><i>no</i></b>.</p>


<h3 id="yes-or-no-opposite">yes-or-no-opposite</h3>
<p>This action supplies <b><i>no</i></b> if the text that follows contains the word <b><i>yes</i></b>, and otherwise this action supplies <b><i>yes</i></b>.&nbsp; If no operand is supplied (which occurs if the intended operand is a parameter phrase that supplies no text), then this action supplies <b><i>yes</i></b>.</p>


<h3 id="yes-if-all-yes">yes-if-all-yes</h3>
<p>This action supplies <b><i>yes</i></b> if the following text contains the text <b><i>yes</i></b> or any number of <b><i>yes</i></b> words (either with or without separating spaces) and no other (non-space) characters, and supplies <b><i>no</i></b> otherwise.&nbsp; This action is similar to the logic AND operator in other languages.&nbsp; If there are no operands, this action supplies <b><i>no</i></b>.</p>


<h3 id="yes-if-any-yes">yes-if-any-yes</h3>
<p>This action supplies <b><i>yes</i></b> if the following text contains the text <b><i>yes</i></b>, and supplies <b><i>no</i></b> otherwise.&nbsp; This action is similar to the logic OR operator in other languages.&nbsp; If there are no operands, this action supplies <b><i>no</i></b>.</p>


<h3 id="no-if-any-no">no-if-any-no</h3>
<p>This action supplies <b><i>no</i></b> if the following text contains the text <b><i>no</i></b>, and supplies <b><i>yes</i></b> otherwise.&nbsp; If there are no operands, this action supplies <b><i>yes</i></b>.</p>


<h3 id="yes-if-not-no">yes-if-not-no</h3>
<p>This action supplies <b><i>no</i></b> if the following word (space-delimited characters) is <b><i>no</i></b>, and supplies <b><i>yes</i></b> otherwise.&nbsp; This action is useful if the word can be something other than <b><i>yes</i></b> or <b><i>no</i></b>, but only <b><i>no</i></b> is significant.&nbsp; If there are no operands, this action supplies <b><i>yes</i></b>.</p>


<h3 id="no-if-not-yes">no-if-not-yes</h3>
<p>This action supplies <b><i>yes</i></b> if the following word (space-delimited characters) is <b><i>yes</i></b>, and supplies <b><i>no</i></b> otherwise.&nbsp; This action is useful if the word can be something other than <b><i>yes</i></b> or <b><i>no</i></b>, but only <b><i>yes</i></b> is significant.&nbsp; If there are no operands, this action supplies <b><i>no</i></b>.</p>


<h2>Loop-related phrases</h2>


<h3 id="use-handler-with-each-word-in-phrase">use-handler-with-each-word-in-phrase</h3>
<p>This action expands the named handler (which is just a named phrase) multiple times, once for each word in the second phrase.&nbsp; Each time the handler is expanded, the phrase <b><i>51</i></b> contains the next word.&nbsp; Nothing is supplied as a result.&nbsp; Instead, the handler needs to store any changes in specified phrases (or in specified files).&nbsp; The content in the second phrase must not change during the time this expansion is being done.&nbsp; If the content in the second phrase begins or ends with a space, the leading and trailing spaces will be removed (even though this content is otherwise treated as a read-only list). </p> <p> Most commonly this action is used to generate a list, in which case the handler either appends text to a single phrase, or generates multiple new phrases (which are typically named using the content of the phrase <b><i>word-to-use-in-handler</i></b> as part of the phrase name).&nbsp; Internally this action inserts parameter phrases that make use of an internal dashrep action named <b><i>use-handler-with-each-word-in-phrase-currently-at-character-position</i></b>.</p>


<h3 id="word-to-use-in-handler">word-to-use-in-handler</h3>
<p>This phrase is used with the action <b><i>use-handler-with-each-word-in-phrase</i></b>.</p>


<h2>Word-related phrases</h2>


<h3 id="get-count-of-words">get-count-of-words</h3>
<p>This action counts the number of words in the definition of a specified phrase, and supplies the count as its result.&nbsp; Words are regarded as text items that do not contain any spaces, and which are separated by one (or more) spaces.&nbsp; If the definition contains only spaces, or is empty, the value <b><i>0</i></b> (zero) is supplied.</p>


<h3 id="get-word-at-position">get-word-at-position</h3>
<p>This action supplies a word that is contained at the specified <b><i>word</i></b> position (not character position) within the second phrase.&nbsp; The word position is supplied as an integer number.&nbsp; The word positions are numbered starting with 1 at the first word position.&nbsp; Words are regarded as text items that do not contain any spaces, and which are separated by one (or more) spaces. Example: If the first phrase contains <b><i>whale dolphin starfish jellyfish dolphin</i></b> and the second operand is <b><i>2</i></b> then the supplied value is <b><i>dolphin</i></b>.</p>


<h3 id="get-position-of-word">get-position-of-word</h3>
<p>This action searches for a specified word within text that contains the space-delimited word, and supplies the <b>word</b> position (not character position) of the first match.&nbsp; If there is no match, a <b><i>0</i></b> (zero) is supplied.&nbsp; The word positions are numbered starting with 1 at the first word position.&nbsp; The supplied word is the word in the first phrase. Example: If the first phrase contains the word <b><i>dolphin</i></b> and the second phrase contains <b><i>whale dolphin starfish jellyfish dolphin</i></b> then the supplied value is <b><i>2</i></b>.</p>


<h3 id="copy-word-at-position">copy-word-at-position</h3>
<p>This action copies one word from the definition of the first phrase into the definition of the second phrase, with the word position being specified by a number.&nbsp; A position number of 1 indicates the first word in the definition.&nbsp; The words are any sequence of characters that does not include a space, and spaces are regarded as the separation between each pair of words.</p>


<h3 id="copy-words-from-position-to-position">copy-words-from-position-to-position</h3>
<p>This action gets the space-delimited words from the first phrase starting at the position indicated by the integer number in the third parameter, and ending at the position indicated by the integer number in the fourth parameter.&nbsp; The word positions are numbered starting with 1 at the beginning.&nbsp; If the ending number is greater than the number of words, then the entire remainder of the phrase is retrieved (which means that using a large second number such as 9999 eliminates needing to know how many words are in the phrase).&nbsp; The first two phrase names can be the same.</p>


<h2>List-manipulation phrases</h2>


<h3 id="copy-words-found-in-both-lists">copy-words-found-in-both-lists</h3>
<p>This action copies into the definition of the third phrase any words that appear in both of the indicated phrase definitions.&nbsp; If a word appears more than once in either list, and it appears in both lists, it appears only once in the result.&nbsp; The order of the words in the result matches the order in which those words first appear in the first list. </p> <p> Example: If the first phrase definition is <b><i>abc 123 def 456</i></b> and the second definition is <b><i>def 789 xyz 123</i></b> then the third phrase is defined as <b><i>123 def</i></b>.</p>


<h3 id="copy-words-found-in-either-list">copy-words-found-in-either-list</h3>
<p>This action copies into the definition of the third phrase the words that appear in either of the indicated phrase definitions, without repeating any word. </p> <p> Example: If the first phrase definition is <b><i>abc 123 def 456</i></b> and the second definition is <b><i>def 789 xyz 123</i></b> then the third phrase is defined as <b><i>abc 123 def 456 xyz 789</i></b> (although the word order can be different).</p>


<h3 id="copy-words-found-only-in-first-list">copy-words-found-only-in-first-list</h3>
<p>This action copies into the definition of the third phrase any words that appear in the first phrase definition but do not appear in the second phrase definition.&nbsp; The order of words in the target phrase matches the order of words in the first list.&nbsp; If a word appears multiple times in the first list and it qualifies to appear in the result, that word appears multiple times, in the same order as in the first list.&nbsp; The action <b><i>copy-words-unique-only</i></b> can be used to eliminate duplicate words. </p> <p> Example: If the first phrase definition is <b><i>abc 123 def 456 abc</i></b> and the second definition is <b><i>def 789 xyz 123</i></b> then the third phrase is defined as <b><i>abc 456 abc</i></b>.</p>


<h3 id="copy-words-that-begin-with-text">copy-words-that-begin-with-text</h3>
<p>This action looks at all the words in the first phrase and identifies the words that begin with the text in the third phrase, and puts those partially (or fully) matching words into the second phrase, with a space between each phrase name. </p> <p> Example: If the first phrase contains <b><i>honeybees bees honey hives beehives</i></b> and the third phrase contains <b><i>bee</i></b> then the second phrase will contain <b><i>bees beehives</i></b>.</p>


<h3 id="copy-words-that-begin-with-listed-words">copy-words-that-begin-with-listed-words</h3>
<p>This action looks at all the words in the first phrase and identifies the words that begin with text that match any of the words listed in the third phrase, and puts those partially (or fully) matching words into the second phrase, with a space between each phrase name. </p> <p> Example: If the first phrase contains <b><i>honeybees bees honey hives beehives</i></b> and the third phrase contains <b><i>bee hive</i></b> then the second phrase will contain <b><i>bees hives beehives</i></b>.</p>


<h3 id="copy-words-that-contain-listed-words">copy-words-that-contain-listed-words</h3>
<p>This action looks at all the words in the first phrase and identifies the words that contain text that match any of the words listed in the third phrase, and puts those partially (or fully) matching words into the second phrase, with a space between each phrase name. </p> <p> Example: If the first phrase contains <b><i>honeybees bees honey hives beehives</i></b> and the third phrase contains <b><i>bee hive</i></b> then the second phrase will contain <b><i>honeybees bees hives beehives</i></b> (but not <b><i>honey</i></b> ).</p>


<h3 id="copy-words-unique-only">copy-words-unique-only</h3>
<p>This action copies from the definition of the first phrase all the words that appear in that definition, but without repeating any words that are repeated in the definition.&nbsp; The position of the first occurrence of a word determines the position of that word in the result list.&nbsp; In addition, the special phrase <b><i>list-of-unique-word-counts</i></b> contains a list of counts that indicate how many times each word (in the result list) occurs in the original list.&nbsp; In addition, the special phrase <b><i>list-of-pointers-to-unique-words</i></b> contains a list of pointers to the space-delimited words in the original list, and these pointers are in the same sequence as the result list, but without including any positions of words that are duplicate words.&nbsp; The pointer list is useful when the original list is in the same sequence as other lists that contain other information about the same items, and a specific number of unique items at the beginning of the result list need to be identified in a way that does not lose the association between the unique items and the other information in the other lists. </p> <p> Example: If the first phrase definition is <b><i>dolphin whale whale starfish dolphin</i></b> then the second phrase is defined as <b><i>dolphin whale starfish</i></b>.&nbsp; In addition, the phrase <b><i>list-of-unique-word-counts</i></b> contains <b><i>2 2 1</i></b>.&nbsp; In addition, the phrase <b><i>list-of-pointers-to-unique-words</i></b> contains <b><i>1 2 4</i></b>.</p>


<h3 id="list-of-unique-word-counts">list-of-unique-word-counts</h3>
<p>This phrase contains a list of word counts for the unique words found by the most recent use of the action <b><i>copy-words-unique-only</i></b>.&nbsp; If that action has not yet been used, this phrase is empty.&nbsp; See <b><i>copy-words-unique-only</i></b> for details.</p>


<h3 id="list-of-pointers-to-unique-words">list-of-pointers-to-unique-words</h3>
<p>This phrase contains a list of word pointers for the unique words found by the most recent use of the action <b><i>copy-words-unique-only</i></b>.&nbsp; If that action has not yet been used, this phrase is empty.&nbsp; See <b><i>copy-words-unique-only</i></b> for details.</p>


<h3 id="copy-words-order-reversed">copy-words-order-reversed</h3>
<p>This action gets the space-delimited words in the first phrase, and reverses their order (sequence), and puts those reverse-ordered words into the second phrase.&nbsp; The two phrase names can be the same. </p> <p> Example: If the first phrase contains <b><i>dolphin whale octopus</i></b> then the second phrase will contain <b><i>octopus whale dolphin</i></b>.</p>


<h3 id="copy-words-at-skip-interval">copy-words-at-skip-interval</h3>
<p>This action copies some space-delimited words from the first phrase to the second phrase using the skip interval specified by the integer number in the third phrase.&nbsp; The first word is always copied, unless the first phrase is empty.&nbsp; The skip interval is the distance between copied words.&nbsp; The word positions are numbered starting with 1 at the beginning.&nbsp; The first two phrase names can be the same. </p> <p> Example: If the first phrase contains <b><i>1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8</i></b> and the third phrase contains <b><i>2</i></b> then the second phrase will contain <b><i>1 3 5 7</i></b>.</p>


<h3 id="generate-counts-from-integer-to-integer">generate-counts-from-integer-to-integer</h3>
<p>This action generates a list of integers and puts them into the definition of the third phrase.&nbsp; The supplied integers indicate the starting and ending values. </p> <p> Example: <b><i>generate-counts-from-integer-to-integer 1 10 one-to-ten</i></b> defines the phrase <b><i>one-to-ten</i></b> as <b><i>1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10</i></b>.</p>


<h3 id="generate-every-pairwise-combination-of-words">generate-every-pairwise-combination-of-words</h3>
<p>This action generates two word-based lists that are named according to the third phrase and the fourth phrase, where each pair of words is one possible combination of words listed in the first phrase and the second phrase. </p> <p> Example: If the first phrase contains <b><i>dolphin eagle bear</i></b> and the second phrase contains <b><i>leaps flies ambles</i></b> then the third phrase will contain <b><i>dolphin dolphin dolphin eagle eagle eagle bear bear bear</i></b> and the fourth phrase will contain <b><i>leaps flies ambles leaps flies ambles leaps flies ambles</i></b>.</p>


<h3 id="generate-every-ordered-pairwise-combination-of-words">generate-every-ordered-pairwise-combination-of-words</h3>
<p>This action generates two word-based lists that are named according to the third phrase and the fourth phrase, where each pair of words is one possible <b>ordered</b> combination of words listed in the first phrase and the second phrase. </p> <p> Example: If the first phrase contains <b><i>dolphin eagle bear</i></b> and the second phrase contains <b><i>leaps flies ambles</i></b> then the third phrase will contain <b><i>dolphin eagle bear eagle bear bear</i></b> and the fourth phrase will contain <b><i>leaps leaps leaps flies flies ambles</i></b>.</p>


<h2>Character-related phrases</h2>


<h3 id="get-count-of-characters">get-count-of-characters</h3>
<p>This action counts the number of characters in the definition that is associated with the specified phrase, and supplies the number as its result.&nbsp; Spaces and non-visible characters (such as the newline character) are included in the count.</p>


<h3 id="get-characters-from-position-to-position">get-characters-from-position-to-position</h3>
<p>This action gets the characters from the specified phrase starting at the position indicated by the first number, and ending at the position indicated by the second number.&nbsp; The character positions are numbered starting with 1 at the first character position.&nbsp; If the second number is greater than the number of characters, then the entire remainder of the phrase is retrieved (which means that using a large second number such as 9999 eliminates needing to know how many characters are in the phrase).</p>


<h3 id="copy-characters-from-position-to-position">copy-characters-from-position-to-position</h3>
<p>This action copies specified characters from the first phrase to the second phrase.&nbsp; The third and fourth operands indicate the starting and ending character positions, with the first character position being numbered one (1).&nbsp; The starting character position must not be larger than the ending character position.&nbsp; The first two phrase names can be the same.</p>


<h3 id="copy-without-extra-spaces">copy-without-extra-spaces</h3>
<p>This action removes multiple adjacent spaces so that only single spaces occur, and removes all spaces at the beginning and end of the text.&nbsp; The first phrase specifies the source text, and the second phrase specifies the destination.&nbsp; The two phrase names can be the same.</p>


<h3 id="copy-lowercase-only">copy-lowercase-only</h3>
<p>This action copies the definition of the first phrase into the definition of the second phrase, but changes any uppercase characters (such as <b><i>A</i></b> and <b><i>B</i></b>) into lowercase characters (such as <b><i>a</i></b> and <b><i>b</i></b>).&nbsp; The two phrase names can be the same.</p>


<h3 id="copy-uppercase-only">copy-uppercase-only</h3>
<p>This action copies the definition of the first phrase into the definition of the second phrase, but changes any lowercase characters (such as <b><i>a</i></b> and <b><i>b</i></b>) into uppercase characters (such as <b><i>A</i></b> and <b><i>B</i></b>).&nbsp; The two phrase names can be the same.</p>


<h3 id="copy-initial-caps">copy-initial-caps</h3>
<p>This action copies the definition of the first phrase into the definition of the second phrase, but changes the first letter of each space-delimited word into its equivalent uppercase letter.&nbsp; The remaining letters within the same word are not changed.&nbsp; If the first character after a space is a symbol or digit, that word remains unchanged.&nbsp; If the definition begins with a letter, that letter is converted to uppercase, even though it does not follow a space.&nbsp; The two phrase names can be the same.</p>


<h3 id="copy-zero-pad-left-to-length">copy-zero-pad-left-to-length</h3>
<p>This action copies text from the definition of the first phrase into the definition of the second phrase and inserts zeros (<b><i>0</i></b>) to the left of the copied characters.&nbsp; The resulting padded text has the length specified by the number in the third operand.&nbsp; Normally this action is used with numbers, but the action does not check whether the copied text is a number.</p>


<h3 id="encode-as-cgi-parameter">encode-as-cgi-parameter</h3>
<p>This action converts symbols and other non-alphabetic and non-digit characters into the special format that allows the text to be passed to a web server as a CGI parameter.&nbsp; As an example, a comma is represented as <b>%2c</b>.&nbsp; The two phrase names can be the same.</p>


<h3 id="decode-from-cgi-parameter">decode-from-cgi-parameter</h3>
<p>This action converts a CGI parameter into normal (non-encoded) characters.&nbsp; This action is the inverse of the <b><i>copy-from-phrase-to-phrase-and-encode-as-cgi-parameter</i></b> action.&nbsp; As an example, the text <b>%2c</b> is converted into a space character.&nbsp; The two phrase names can be the same.</p>


<h3 id="convert-unicode-to-html-entities">convert-unicode-to-html-entities</h3>
<p>This action copies all the text from the first phrase into the second phrase but converts non-ASCII characters into HTML entities.&nbsp; The HTML entities use decimal numbers, which means that open double quotation marks become &#8220; and &#8221;.</p>


<h2>Search-and-replace-related phrases</h2>


<h3 id="get-position-of-matching-text">get-position-of-matching-text</h3>
<p>This action searches for the characters from the first phrase, and performs the search within the second phrase, and supplies the character position of the first match.&nbsp; If there is no match, a <b><i>0</i></b> (zero) is supplied.&nbsp; The character positions are numbered starting with 1 at the first character position.</p>


<h3 id="copy-and-replace">copy-and-replace</h3>
<p>This action replaces each occurrence of the third phrase with the text in the fourth phrase, based on the text in the first phrase, and places the result into the second phrase.&nbsp; If the replacement phrase contains the search phrase, nothing is changed, and a warning is put into the trace information because that could cause an endless loop.&nbsp; The special phrases <b><i>character-space</i></b> and <b><i>character-hyphen</i></b> and <b><i>character-newline</i></b> are useful here (because the language does not have ways to define those characters).&nbsp; The first two phrase names can be the same.</p>


<h3 id="copy-and-replace-using-paired-listed-words">copy-and-replace-using-paired-listed-words</h3>
<p>This action copies the definition of the first phrase into the definition of the second phrase, but replaces some text strings with associated text strings, using paired words in the third operand.&nbsp; The paired words in the third operand are delimited by spaces, and the first word in each pair specifies what text to find, and the second word in each pair specifies the replacement text for that found word. </p> <p> Example: To replace named HTML entities and some special characters with their unicode equivalent entities, the third phrase can contain text such as the following: <b><i>&#38;amp; &#38;#38; &#38;lt; &#38;#60; < &#38;#60 &#38;gt; &#38;#62; > &#38;#62; &#38;ldquo; &#38;#8220; &#38;rdquo; &#38;#8221; &#38;lsquo; &#38;#8216; &#38;rsquo; &#38;#8217; &#38;quot; &#38;#34; " &#38;#34; &#38;apos; &#38;#39; ' &#38;#39; &#38;nbsp; &#38;#160;</i></b> </p> <p> Another example: To identify a numeric pattern by converting all digits into the digit nine, the third phrase can contain the following text: <b><i>0 9 1 9 2 9 3 9 4 9 5 9 6 9 7 9 8 9</i></b>&nbsp; </p> <p> As these examples illustrate, the words can include single characters.&nbsp; Obviously none of the words in the third phrase can contain a space.&nbsp; If any searched words or any inserted words contain text that matches other searched words, the result becomes unpredictable.&nbsp; The first two phrase names can be the same.</p>


<h3 id="generate-positions-of-delimiter">generate-positions-of-delimiter</h3>
<p>This action searches for the text contained in the first phrase, and performs repeated searches within the second phrase, and puts into the third phrase the list of character positions of all the matches.&nbsp; If there is no match, the list is empty.&nbsp; The character positions are numbered starting with 1 at the first character position, and the numbers indicate the position of the first character in the matching text.</p>


<h3 id="generate-positions-of-listed-words">generate-positions-of-listed-words</h3>
<p>This action searches for any of the space-delimited words contained in the first phrase, and finds those text items within the second phrase, and puts into the third phrase the list of beginning and ending character positions of all the matches.&nbsp; The spaces in the first phrase are needed to separate the text items, but spaces in the second phrase are not needed in order for a text item to match.&nbsp; If there is no match, the generated list is empty.&nbsp; The character positions are numbered starting with 1 at the first character position, and the listed numbers indicate the beginning and ending character positions of any matching text. </p> <p> Example: If the first phrase contains <b><i>fish bird</i></b> and the second phrase contains <b><i>birds songbird fish clownfish</i></b> then the third phrase will contain <b><i>1 4 11 14 16 19 26 29</i></b>.</p>


<h3 id="generate-positions-of-first-matching-delimiter-after-listed-positions">generate-positions-of-first-matching-delimiter-after-listed-positions</h3>
<p>This action searches for the text contained in the first phrase, and performs repeated searches within the second phrase, but starts each search at the positions listed in the third phrase, and only finds the first match after that position, and puts into the fourth phrase the list of character positions of all the matches.&nbsp; If there is no match, the list is empty.&nbsp; The character positions are numbered starting with 1 at the first character position, and the numbers indicate the position of the first character in the matching text.</p>


<h2>Time-related phrases</h2>


<h3 id="get-current-time-in-epoch-seconds">get-current-time-in-epoch-seconds</h3>
<p>This action gets the current time as an integer number that indicates the number of seconds since January 1, 1970 at midnight GMT (UTC).&nbsp; This convention matches the convention used in Linux and Windows, but not the convention used by Apple.</p>


<h3 id="split-epoch-seconds-into-named-components">split-epoch-seconds-into-named-components</h3>
<p>This action uses the supplied epoch seconds to put appropriate numbers into the phrases that begin with the word <b><i>time</i></b>.&nbsp; The results are specific to local time at the server location.&nbsp; Simple Dashrep definitions can use these values to easily generate nearly any date and time format.&nbsp; See also <b><i>split-epoch-seconds-into-named-components-for-zero-meridian</i></b>, which applies to the time at zero meridian.</p>


<h3 id="split-epoch-seconds-into-named-components-for-zero-meridian">split-epoch-seconds-into-named-components-for-zero-meridian</h3>
<p>This action uses the supplied epoch seconds to put appropriate numbers into the phrases that begin with the word <b><i>time</i></b>.&nbsp; The results are specific for UTC.&nbsp; Addition and substraction can be used to convert to a specific time zone.&nbsp; Simple Dashrep definitions can use these values to easily generate nearly any date and time format.&nbsp; See also <b><i>split-epoch-seconds-into-named-components</i></b>, which applies to local time at the server.</p>


<h3 id="time-day-of-month">time-day-of-month</h3>
<p>This phrase contains the day of the month (such as 1, 2, ... 31), based on the epoch seconds supplied to the action <b><i>split-epoch-seconds-into-named-components</i></b> or <b><i>split-epoch-seconds-into-named-components-for-zero-meridian</i></b>.</p>

<h3 id="copy-words-rearrange-using-order-sort-numeric">copy-words-rearrange-using-order-sort-numeric</h3>
<p>This action gets the space-delimited words in the first phrase, and moves those words into the second phrase using the numeric sort order specified in the third phrase.&nbsp; The first two phrase names can be the same. </p> <p> Example: If the first phrase contains the text <b><i>seven one five three twelve</i></b> and the third phrase contains the text <b><i>7 1 5 3 12</i></b> then the text placed into the second phrase will be <b><i>one three five seven twelve</i></b>.</p>


<h3 id="numeric-equal-greater-less-compare">numeric-equal-greater-less-compare</h3>
<p>This action supplies the word <b><i>equal</i></b> if the two numbers that follow are numerically equal, or supplies the word <b><i>greater</i></b> if the first number is greater than the second number, or supplies the word <b><i>less</i></b> if the first number is less than the second number.</p>


<h3 id="numeric-add">numeric-add</h3>
<p>This action adds the numbers that follow, and supplies the result.&nbsp; The numbers can be positive or negative integers, or they can be positive or negative decimal numbers, but floating-point numbers are not recognized.&nbsp; As applies to all Dashrep numeric calculations, each calculation converts the text-based digits into binary values, and the result is converted back into text-based digits, so the calculations are slow compared to the speed of most programming languages.&nbsp; If more than a few simple calculations are being done, consider doing the intensive numerical processing in a different programming language.</p>


<h3 id="numeric-minus">numeric-minus</h3>
<p>This action subtracts the second number from the first number, and supplies the result.&nbsp; See <b><i>numeric-add</i></b> for additional information.</p>

<h3 id="numeric-minimum">numeric-minimum</h3>
<p>This action determines the minimum value of the numbers that follow, and supplies the result.&nbsp; See <b><i>numeric-add</i></b> for additional information.</p>


<h3 id="numeric-increment">numeric-increment</h3>
<p>This action increments (increases by one) the integer value in the named phrase.&nbsp; This action does not insert the result into text being expanded.&nbsp; The number in the specified phrase is incremented each time this special action is encountered.&nbsp; Use of this action should be avoided.&nbsp; Usually the action <b><i>use-handler-with-each-word-in-phrase</i></b>, or the action <b><i>generate-counts-from-integer-to-integer</i></b>, or the action <b><i>unique-value</i></b> can be used instead.</p>


<h3 id="numeric-decrement">numeric-decrement</h3>
<p>This action decrements (reduces by one) the integer value in the named phrase.&nbsp; Use of this action should be avoided.&nbsp; Usually the actions <b><i>generate-counts-from-integer-to-integer</i></b> and <b><i>copy-words-order-reversed</i></b> can be used instead. This action is useful for debugging situations that loop many more times than expected.</p>


<h3 id="numeric-integer">numeric-integer</h3>
<p>This action calculates the integer value of a real number, and supplies the result.&nbsp; If an integer is supplied, the same integer is returned (although leading zeros, if present, are removed).</p>

<p>This action calculates the absolute value of the number that follows, and supplies the result.</p>


<h3 id="numeric-odd-or-even">numeric-odd-or-even</h3>
<p>This action supplies the word <b><i>odd</i></b> or <b><i>even</i></b> based on whether the value of the following operand is an odd or even integer.&nbsp; It is useful for handling row (or column) numbers in a table.&nbsp; The result is unpredictable if the operand is not a positive integer.</p>


<h3 id="numeric-sine">numeric-sine</h3>
<p>This action calculates the (trigonometric) sine of the number that follows, and supplies the result.</p>


<h3 id="numeric-cosine">numeric-cosine</h3>
<p>This action calculates the (trigonometric) cosine of the number that follows, and supplies the result.</p>


<h3 id="numeric-logarithm-base-e">numeric-logarithm-base-e</h3>
<p>This action calculates the base-e logarithm of the specified number, and supplies the result.&nbsp; The number is assumed to be a positive number.&nbsp; If the supplied value is a very small number less than one (typically less than 0.000001) then the result is a large negative number such as -999999.</p>


<h3 id="numeric-logarithm-base-10">numeric-logarithm-base-10</h3>
<p>This action calculates the base-10 logarithm of the specified number, and supplies the result.&nbsp; The number is assumed to be a positive number.&nbsp; If the supplied value is a very small number less than one (typically less than 0.000001) then the result is a large negative number such as -999999.</p>

<p>This action supplies the text representation for the value of pi.</p>


<h3 id="numeric-vector-add-number">numeric-vector-add-number</h3>
<p>This action adds a single number to each number in the supplied vector and produces a vector sum.&nbsp; Each vector is a space-delimited list of numbers.&nbsp; The vector in the definition of the first operand is added to the single number that is supplied as the second operand.&nbsp; The resulting vector is put into the definition of the third operand.&nbsp; The numbers can be positive or negative integers, or they can be positive or negative decimal numbers, but floating-point numbers are not recognized.&nbsp; If subtraction is needed, either insert a minus sign in front of a positive integer, or multiply the single number times minus one before using it in this action.&nbsp; As applies to all Dashrep numeric calculations, each calculation converts the text-based digits into binary values, and the result is converted back into text-based digits, so the calculations are slow compared to the speed of most programming languages.</p>


<h3 id="numeric-vector-multiply-by-number">numeric-vector-multiply-by-number</h3>
<p>This action multiplies a vector times a single number and produces a resulting vector.&nbsp; Each vector is a space-delimited list of numbers.&nbsp; The vector in the definition of the first operand is multiplied by the second operand, and the resulting vector is put into the definition of the third operand.&nbsp; The numbers can be positive or negative integers, or they can be positive or negative decimal numbers, but floating-point numbers are not recognized.&nbsp; As applies to all Dashrep numeric calculations, each calculation converts the text-based digits into binary values, and the result is converted back into text-based digits, so the calculations are slow compared to the speed of most programming languages.</p>


<h3 id="numeric-vectors-add">numeric-vectors-add</h3>
<p>This action adds two vectors and produces a vector sum.&nbsp; Each vector is a space-delimited list of numbers.&nbsp; The vector in the definition of the first operand is added to the vector in the definition of the second operand, and the resulting vector is put into the definition of the third operand.&nbsp; The numbers can be positive or negative integers, or they can be positive or negative decimal numbers, but floating-point numbers are not recognized.&nbsp; If vector subtraction is needed, use the action <b><i>numeric-vector-multiply-by-number</i></b> to multiply one of the vectors by minus one, and then add the resulting vector to the positive-sign vector.&nbsp; As applies to all Dashrep numeric calculations, each calculation converts the text-based digits into binary values, and the result is converted back into text-based digits, so the calculations are slow compared to the speed of most programming languages.</p>


<h3 id="numeric-vectors-multiply">numeric-vectors-multiply</h3>
<p>This action multiplies two vectors and produces a vector result.&nbsp; See the description of the action <b><i>numeric-vectors-add</i></b> for additional information.</p>


<h3 id="numeric-vectors-divide-by">numeric-vectors-divide-by</h3>
<p>This action divides two vectors and produces a vector result.&nbsp; To prevent dividing by zero, if a calculation involves dividing by a very small decimal number, a very large number is supplied as a result (regardless of the size of the other number).&nbsp; See the description of the action <b><i>numeric-vectors-add</i></b> for additional information.</p>


<h3 id="numeric-vector-integers">numeric-vector-integers</h3>
<p>This action converts into integers the real numbers that are supplied in the vector that is named in the first operand.&nbsp; The vector is a space-delimited list of numbers, which can include integers as well as real numbers.&nbsp; The resulting vector is put into the definition of the second operand.&nbsp; Floating-point numbers are not recognized.</p>


<h3 id="numeric-vector-absolutes">numeric-vector-absolutes</h3>
<p>This action converts a list of numbers within a vector into their absolute values, and puts the resulting list into the definition of the second operand.&nbsp; The vector is a space-delimited list of numbers, which can include integers as well as real numbers.&nbsp; Floating-point numbers are not recognized.</p>


<h3 id="numeric-vectors-from-delta-values-calculate-distances">numeric-vectors-from-delta-values-calculate-distances</h3>
<p>This action gets the list of space-delimited delta X integer numbers in the definition of the first operand and gets the list of space-delimited delta Y integer numbers in the definition of the second operand, and calculates a list of integer distances that are put into the definition of the third operand.&nbsp; The numbers can be positive or negative integers.&nbsp; Although decimal numbers can be supplied, the resulting values are truncated to integer values, so the decimal portion is lost.&nbsp; Floating-point numbers are not recognized.&nbsp; As applies to all Dashrep numeric calculations, each calculation converts the text-based digits into binary values, and the result is converted back into text-based digits, so the calculations are slow compared to the speed of most programming languages.</p>


<h3 id="numeric-two-dimensional-sort-into-columns-and-rows">numeric-two-dimensional-sort-into-columns-and-rows</h3>
<p>This action arranges a set of items into a table of rows and columns based on numeric values along two dimensions.&nbsp; The resulting arrangement roughly arranges the items from left to right according to one set of numeric values and arranges the items from bottom to top according to a second (independent) set of numeric values.&nbsp; This action requires four operands, where the first operand is the number of columns, the second operand is the name of a phrase that contains space-delimited numbers that affect horizontal (left-to-right) placement, the third operand is the name of a phrase that contains space-delimited numbers that affect vertical (top-to-bottom) placement, and the fourth operand is the name of the phrase into which the results are placed.&nbsp; The result contains a sequence of words such as <b><i>row-3-column-2</i></b> that indicate the sorted position of each item, with the result sequence being the same sequence as the two lists of numeric values.&nbsp; The number of items to be sorted is determined by the number of values in the two numeric lists (which must be the same length).&nbsp; The items with the largest vertical values appear at the top, the items with the smallest vertical values appear at the bottom, the items with the largest horizontal values appear at the right, and the items with the smallest horizontal values appear at the left.&nbsp; This vertical convention is the opposite of the document-oriented convention of placing larger vertical values at the bottom, and instead this convention matches the natural-world-oriented convention of placing larger vertical values at the top.</p>


<h3 id="numeric-y-map-tile-number-based-on-latitude">numeric-y-map-tile-number-based-on-latitude</h3>
<p>This action calculates the "y" value for the upper-left corner of the Open Street Maps map tile, based on the latitude that is supplied, and based on the zoom value in the phrase <b><i>numeric-map-tile-zoom</i></b>, and supplies the result.</p>


<h3 id="numeric-map-tile-zoom">numeric-map-tile-zoom</h3>

<h2>Alphabetical-order-related phrases</h2>


<h3 id="copy-words-sort-alphabetic">copy-words-sort-alphabetic</h3>
<p>This action gets the space-delimited words in the first phrase, and sorts those words alphabetically, and puts those sorted words into the second phrase.&nbsp; The two phrase names can be the same.</p>


<h3 id="copy-words-rearrange-using-order-sort-alphabetic">copy-words-rearrange-using-order-sort-alphabetic</h3>
<p>This action gets the space-delimited words in the first phrase, and moves those words into the second phrase using the alphabetical sort order specified by the words in the third phrase.&nbsp; The first two phrase names can be the same. </p> <p> Example: If the first phrase contains the text <b><i>Nikola_Tesla Abe_Lincoln Thomas_Jefferson Paul_MacCready</i></b> and the third phrase contains the text <b><i>tesla_nikola jefferson_thomas da_vinci_leonardo maccready_paul</i></b> then the text placed into the second phrase will be <b><i>Leonardo_da_Vinci Thomas_Jefferson Paul_MacCready Nikola_Tesla</i></b>.</p>


<h2>XML-related phrases</h2>


<h3 id="xml-move-attributes-into-tag-elements">xml-move-attributes-into-tag-elements</h3>
<p>This action moves the content of an <b><i>attribute</i></b> tag or a <b><i>specify</i></b> tag inside the preceding tag. </p> <p> Example: it converts the text <b><i>&lt;img /&gt;&lt;attribute href="image.jpg"&gt;&lt;attribute alt="image"&gt;</i></b> into the text <b><i>&lt;img href="image.jpg" alt="image" /&gt;</i></b>. </p> <p> The word <b><i>specify</i></b> can be used instead of <b><i>attribute</i></b>.&nbsp; This functionality is useful for generating XML and HTML code by using hyphenated phrases such as <b><i>image-here specify-href image.jpg specify-end specify-alt image specify-end</i></b>.&nbsp; Without this approach the generation of HTML and XML code would require specifying the nesting of the beginning and ending of a tag, such as <b><i>image-here-begin</i></b> and <b><i>image-here-end</i></b>.</p>


<h3 id="copy-and-remove-attributes-from-xml-tags">copy-and-remove-attributes-from-xml-tags</h3>
<p>This action removes attributes from XML and HTML tags, and also removes RSS-style <b><i>CDATA</i></b> strings.&nbsp; The first phrase specifies the source text, and the second phrase specifies the destination.&nbsp; The two phrase names can be the same. </p> <p> Example: If the specified phrase contains <b><i>and a &lt;span style="whatever"&gt;dolphin&lt;/span&gt;</i></b>, the result is <b><i>and a &lt;span&gt;dolphin&lt;/span&gt;</i></b>. </p> <p> The change assumes that none of the tag's attributes contain a close angle bracket (<b><i>&gt;</i></b>).&nbsp; The result is not intended to be valid XML or HTML or RSS code.&nbsp; Instead the intended purpose is to simplify the text as preparation for further manipulations.</p>


<h2>File-related phrases</h2>


<h3 id="yes-or-no-permission-to-append-to-files">yes-or-no-permission-to-append-to-files</h3>

<h2>Data-related phrases</h2>


<h3 id="copy-from-columns-in-file-to-named-phrases">copy-from-columns-in-file-to-named-phrases</h3>
<p>This action reads from the specified file all the spreadsheet-like lines of text, and puts each (space-delimited) word into a phrase that has a special name.&nbsp; The specified phrase must begin with the (space-delimited) prefix for all the names, is followed by the (space-delimited) name of each column.&nbsp; The third operand is the name of a phrase that will contain the list of unique values that come from the first word in each line.&nbsp; This action is useful for reading spreadsheet-like data.&nbsp; If a unique value is used more than once, the information in the last occurrence overwrites the earlier information.&nbsp; The filename is specified by the first operand, and the location of that file is specified in the phrase <b><i>dashrep-path-prefix-for-file-reading</i></b>. </p> <p> Example: If the second operand is a phrase that contains <b><i>cell-contents-for-nickname phone-number city state</i></b> and one line of text in the file is <b><i>flipper 123-456-7890 san_diego ca</i></b> then the phrase <b><i>cell-contents-for-nickname-flipper-phone-number</i></b> will contain <b><i>123-456-7890</i></b> and the phrase <b><i>cell-contents-for-nickname-flipper-city</i></b> will contain <b><i>san_diego</i></b> and the phrase <b><i>cell-contents-for-nickname-flipper-state</i></b> will contain <b><i>ca</i></b>. </p> <p> If the phrase <b><i>dashrep-use-two-spaces-as-column-delimiter</i></b> is defined as <b><i>yes</i></b>, then two spaces (instead of one) are required between cells.&nbsp; This option is useful if the spreadsheet-like cell of data might contain any spaces. </p> <p> If the second phrase contains only a single word, then the file is assumed to contain only two columns of data on each line, and a suffix is not appended to the end of the generated phrase names.</p>


<h3 id="copy-from-columns-in-file-to-column-lists">copy-from-columns-in-file-to-column-lists</h3>
<p>This action reads from the specified file all the spreadsheet-like lines of text, and puts the first (space-delimited) word from each line into one list, and puts the second word from each line into another list, and puts the third word from each line into yet another list, and so on.&nbsp; The generated lists are given the phrase name specified by the second operand (not by the definition in the second operand) followed by a hyphen and the column number.&nbsp; This action is useful for reading spreadsheet-like data that contains columns of values, where each column of values is meaningful, such as for doing numeric vector calculations and finding the unique values in each column.&nbsp; Empty lines are ignored.&nbsp; The line of data with the fewest words determines how many lists are generated, and words beyond that number are ignored.&nbsp; The filename is specified by the first operand, and the location of that file is specified in the phrase <b><i>dashrep-path-prefix-for-file-reading</i></b>. </p> <p> Example: If the second operand is the phrase <b><i>list-of-values-in-column</i></b> and the specified file contains three lines of text, with <b><i>flipper 123 234 san_diego</i></b> in the first line, and <b><i>adolph 456 567 miami fl</i></b> in the second line, and <b><i>dory 789 890 los_angeles</i></b> in the third line, then the phrase <b><i>list-of-values-in-column-1</i></b> will contain <b><i>flipper adolph dory</i></b> and the phrase <b><i>list-of-values-in-column-2</i></b> will contain <b><i>123 456 789</i></b> and the phrase <b><i>list-of-values-in-column-3</i></b> will contain <b><i>234 567 890</i></b> and the phrase <b><i>list-of-numbers-in-column-4</i></b> will contain <b><i>san_diego miami los_angeles</i></b>.</p>


<h3 id="yes-or-no-use-two-spaces-as-column-delimiter">yes-or-no-use-two-spaces-as-column-delimiter</h3>
<p>If this phrase equals <b><i>yes</i></b> then the action <b><i>copy-from-columns-in-file-to-named-phrases</i></b> regards two adjacent spaces as the delimiter between words.&nbsp; Any other value for this phrase causes a single space to be regarded as the delimiter between words.&nbsp; This adjustment enables the text in any column of (text) data to contain single spaces.&nbsp; This adjustment avoids the complications that arise from using a tab character as a column delimiter, such as in exported spreadsheet data.</p>


<h3 id="gather-tagged-info-from-file">gather-tagged-info-from-file</h3>
<p>This action reads from the specified file all the lines in that text file, and creates phrase definitions that are based on the first word in each line.&nbsp; When the first word (of a line) matches the definition of the <b><i>dashrep-gather-tag-begin</i></b> phrase (which has a default value of <b><i>entry_begin</i></b> ), a new set of related items begins, and when the first word (of a line) matches the definition of the <b><i>dashrep-gather-tag-end</i></b> phrase (which has a default value of <b><i>entry_end</i></b> ), that set of items ends.&nbsp; When the first word (of a line) matches the definition of the <b><i>dashrep-gather-tag-unique</i></b> phrase (which has a default value of <b><i>url</i></b>, and which must appear within a set of items), the next (space-delimited) word in that line is used as the unique identifier for the items in that set.&nbsp; If the same unique identifier appears in a later set, the items in the new set overwrite the previous items that have the same identifier.&nbsp; Each generated phrase name begins with the tag name (that preceded that item) followed by the text <b><i>-value-for-unique-id-</i></b> and then followed by the unique value.&nbsp; The list of encountered unique values is put into the second-operand phrase. </p> <p> If the text <b><i>multi_line_begin</i></b> immediately follows an item's name, the lines that follow, up to a line that contains (only) <b><i>multi_line_end</i></b>, are combined (with a space between each line's content) into a long value for that named item. </p> <p> If a normal (non-multi) line begins with the definition of the <b><i>dashrep-gather-tag-delete</i></b> phrase (which has a default value of <b><i>delete_id</i></b> ) then the unique value in the second word (of that line) is omitted from the list of encountered unique values.&nbsp; If a later entry specifies a definition for an entry that was requested to be deleted, the later entry overrides the deletion request.&nbsp; A deletion request does not delete any of the already-defined phrases, but those phrases will not be accessed if the created phrases are only accessed using the list of encountered unique values.&nbsp; As an example, an entry with the unique ID of <b><i>1776</i></b> can be deleted by appending (to the file) the line <b><i>delete_id 1776</i></b>. </p> <p> A list of the encountered tag names is put into the phrase <b><i>dashrep-gathered-tag-names</i></b>.&nbsp; The order of the list is the order in which the tag names were first encountered. </p> <p> This "gather" action is useful for accessing database-like text files where the first word in each line acts as the "field" name for a database record, and each set of items corresponds to one database record.&nbsp; This action is also useful for spreadsheet-like information where the tag names are analogous to single-word column titles, and one row of spreadsheet data is stored in multiple lines, with each cell's content on a separate (labelled) line.&nbsp; The order of the items within each set is not significant, and the order does not need to be the same from one set to another.&nbsp; This action does not require that each set of items use the same first words that are used in other sets, but in that case the generated phrases should be checked for undefined (empty) phrase definitions. </p> <p> The location of the source file is specified by the phrase <b><i>dashrep-path-prefix-for-file-reading</i></b>.</p>


<h3 id="gather-from-tagged-file-one-entry">gather-from-tagged-file-one-entry</h3>
<p>This action reads from a file that also can be read by the action <b><i>gather-tagged-info-from-file-and-put-unique-values-into-phrase</i></b> but only gets a single entry and puts that entry into the phrase that is named as the second operand.&nbsp; The first operand is the name of the file.&nbsp; The selected entry is specified by a value in the phrase <b><i>dashrep-gather-tag-matching-id</i></b>.&nbsp; If the text that is defined in the phrase <b><i>dashrep-gather-tag-delete</i></b> appears within the file and applies to the selected entry, then the content prior to that point is deleted, although later entries (after the last deletion) with the same matching value are recognized.</p>


<h3 id="write-gathered-listed-items-to-end-of-file">write-gathered-listed-items-to-end-of-file</h3>
<p>This action writes to the end of the specified file all or most of the information that was recently gathered using the action <b><i>gather-tagged-info-from-file</i></b>.&nbsp; The first operand specifies a phrase that contains the list of unique values for the gathered items to be written, which allows some of the items to be omitted.&nbsp; This action, unlike the "gather" action, does not support the use of multi-line entries.&nbsp; The second operand is the name of the target file.&nbsp; The location of the source file is specified by the phrase <b><i>dashrep-path-prefix-for-file-reading</i></b>.&nbsp; This action uses the list of tag names in the phrase <b><i>dashrep-gathered-tag-names-in-sequence</i></b> to determine which tag names to use, and the sequence in which they are written.</p>

<h2>Definition-related phrases</h2>


<h3 id="generate-list-of-all-dashrep-phrases">generate-list-of-all-dashrep-phrases</h3>
<p>This action generates a list of all the defined phrase names, using a space between adjacent phrase names, and puts that list into the specified phrase name.&nbsp; For security purposes this action can be disabled.&nbsp; The generated list excludes the phrase name <b>four-hyphens</b>.</p>


<h2>Debugging-support phrases</h2>


<h3 id="trace-show">trace-show</h3>
<p>This action displays the definition of the specified phrase in the trace log.&nbsp; These requests are highlighted with multiple asterisks (<b><i>*******</i></b>).&nbsp; The requested information appears in the trace log regardless of whether the <b><i>dashrep-action-trace-on-yes-or-no</i></b> definition is <b><i>yes</i></b> or <b><i>no</i></b>.</p>


<h3 id="dashrep-comments-ignored">dashrep-comments-ignored</h3>
<p>This phrase contains text that the translation process has identified as comments.&nbsp; Comments are contained within the text <b><i>*---</i></b> and <b><i>---*</i></b>, but these delimiters cannot be nested, so this definition can be useful for debugging.</p>


<h3 id="generate-phrase-usage-counts">generate-phrase-usage-counts</h3>
<p>This action puts into the specified phrase a list of counts for how many times each phrase name was replaced.&nbsp; Each count and its associated phrase name are separated from the next count and phrase name by a newline character.&nbsp; The phrases are sorted by the count number, with the highest counts appearing first.&nbsp; Within each count, the order is alphabetical.</p>


<h2>Advanced phrases</h2>


<h3 id="dashrep-language-yes">dashrep-language-yes</h3>
<p>This phrase is written to the beginning of the file created by the action <b><i>write-all-dashrep-definitions-to-file</i></b> so that the first word identifies the file contents to be written in the Dashrep language.&nbsp; The default value for this phrase is <b><i>yes</i></b>, but this definition is not used.</p>


<h3 id="dashrep-version">dashrep-version</h3>
<p>This pre-defined phrase contains the Dashrep version number.&nbsp; This number is not changed with every change in the Dashrep language, but rather tracks major Dashrep changes.</p>


<h3 id="dashrep-undefined">dashrep-undefined</h3>
<p>This phrase contains the text that is inserted in some cases when the result of an action is undefined.&nbsp; The default value is <b><i>dashrep_undefined</i></b>.</p>


<h3 id="dashrep-endless-loop-counter-limit">dashrep-endless-loop-counter-limit</h3>
<p>This phrase specifies the maximum number of replacements allowed during a Dashrep translation.&nbsp; This number can be redefined, such as to a larger number.&nbsp; If this limit is exceeded, Dashrep translation is stopped and an error message indicates which phrase was replaced the most number of times.&nbsp; If large amounts of data are processed, the default number is not going to be large enough.&nbsp; This limit interrupts endless loops, which can occur if a phrase is defined in a way that (either directly or indirectly) includes its own name.</p>


<h3 id="dashrep-time-limit">dashrep-time-limit</h3>
<p>This phrase contains the current number of seconds for use as a time limit.&nbsp; When the time limit is exceeded, translation ends.&nbsp; The default value is 300 seconds, which equals 5 minutes.&nbsp; A different value can be specified, although the changed time limit may not take effect immediately.</p>


<h3 id="insert-codeview-tags">insert-codeview-tags</h3>
<p>This action inserts into the specified phrase definition special tags that enable the raw Dashrep code to be displayed, such as on a web page.&nbsp; The special inserted tags, such as <b><i>&lt;dashrep_codeview_action_begin&gt;</i></b> and <b><i>&lt;dashrep_codeview_action_middle_1&gt;</i></b>, are expected to be replaced by the text items in phrases such as <b><i>dashrep-codeview-action-begin</i></b> and <b><i>dashrep-codeview-action-middle-1</i></b>.</p>


<h3 id="end-of-line-here">end-of-line-here</h3>
<p>This phrase contains text that is inserted at the end of each line when the action <b><i>copy-from-file-to-phrase</i></b> is used, and if the phrase <b><i>dashrep-yes-indicate-line-endings</i></b> equals <b><i>yes</i></b>.</p>


<h3 id="yes-or-no-indicate-line-endings">yes-or-no-indicate-line-endings</h3>
<p>If this phrase equals <b><i>yes</i></b> then the action <b><i>copy-from-file-to-phrase</i></b> inserts the text <b><i>end-of-line-here</i></b> at line-break positions.&nbsp; The <b><i>end-of-line-here</i></b> phrase does not have a default definition.</p>


<h2>Special Dashrep spoken words</h2>


<h3 id="dashbee">dashbee</h3>

<h2>Deprecated phrases, do not use</h2>


<h3 id="expand-parameters-only">expand-parameters-only</h3>
<p>This action expands ("translates") any parameters in the first phrase and puts the results into the second phrase.&nbsp; Unlike the related action <b><i>expand-text</i></b>, this action does not expand any phrases (except the starting named phrase) that appear outside of parameter brackets.&nbsp; This action is especially useful if there needs to be a delay in expanding the non-parameter phrases.</p>


<h3 id="dashrep-definitions-begin">dashrep-definitions-begin</h3>
<p>This directive specifies that the text that follows are phrases and definitions.&nbsp; This phrase cannot be nested.&nbsp; This change continues until the phrase <b><i>dashrep-definitions-end</i></b> is encountered.</p>


<h3 id="dashrep-definitions-end">dashrep-definitions-end</h3>
<p>This directive specifies the end of phrases and definitions that began with the directive <b><i>dashrep-definitions-begin</i></b>.</p>


<h3 id="dashrep-definition-append-next">dashrep-definition-append-next</h3>
<p>This directive requests that the next definition be appended to the existing definition of the specified phrase.&nbsp; This directive allows a list to be created during the reading of definitions because it overrides the normal convention of replacing the existing definition (when the same phrase name is defined more than once).</p>


<h3 id="define-end">define-end</h3>
<p>This directive functions the same as several hyphens (<b><i>----</i></b>) at the end of a definition.&nbsp; It is provided as a speakable alternative for ending a definition.</p>


<h3 id="define-begin">define-begin</h3>
<p>This directive is ignored, but is defined for symmetry so that it can be used after the directive <b><i>define-end</i></b>.&nbsp; It is not needed because the context already determines where a definition begins.</p>


<h3 id="list-of-phrases-newly-defined">list-of-phrases-newly-defined</h3>
<p>This phrase contains a list of all the hyphenated phrases that have been imported or defined.&nbsp; This definition can be cleared to limit the list to phrases that were imported or defined after the definition was cleared.</p>


<h3 id="yes-or-no-append-not-replace-for-imported-phrases">yes-or-no-append-not-replace-for-imported-phrases</h3>
<p>If this phrase equals <b><i>yes</i></b>, and if a phrase definition is being imported from a file, and if that phrase has the same name as an existing phrase, then the definition is appended to the end of the existing definition, rather than replacing the existing definition.&nbsp; A space is inserted to separate the two definitions.&nbsp; This capability is useful when multiple files contain phrase definitions with the same names, and those definitions are lists that should be combined.</p>


<h3 id="yes-or-no-export-delimited-definitions">yes-or-no-export-delimited-definitions</h3>
<p>If this phrase equals <b><i>yes</i></b> then the action <b><i>write-all-dashrep-definitions-to-file</i></b> or the action <b><i>write-dashrep-definitions-listed-in-phrase-to-file</i></b> action is used, special text is inserted at the beginning and end of each phrase name and phrase definition.&nbsp; Otherwise exported definitions are written using the normal Dashrep convention.&nbsp; This capability enables the exported definitions to be converted into special formats such as HTML or XML.</p>


<h3 id="export-defs-all-begin">export-defs-all-begin</h3>
<p>If the phrase <b><i>dashrep-yes-or-no-export-delimited-definitions</i></b> equals <b><i>yes</i></b> when the action <b><i>write-all-dashrep-definitions-to-file</i></b> or the action <b><i>write-all-dashrep-phrase-names-to-file</i></b> or the action <b><i>write-dashrep-definitions-listed-in-phrase-to-file</i></b> is used, this phrase name (enclosed in brackets) is inserted at the beginning of all the written-to-a-file phrase definitions.&nbsp; This capability is useful if the written definitions need to be translated into a different format.</p>


<h3 id="export-defs-all-end">export-defs-all-end</h3>
<p>If the phrase <b><i>dashrep-yes-or-no-export-delimited-definitions</i></b> equals <b><i>yes</i></b> when the action <b><i>write-all-dashrep-definitions-to-file</i></b> or the action <b><i>write-all-dashrep-phrase-names-to-file</i></b> or the action <b><i>write-dashrep-definitions-listed-in-phrase-to-file</i></b> action is used, this phrase name (enclosed in brackets) is inserted at the end of all the written-to-a-file phrase definitions.&nbsp; This capability is useful if the written definitions need to be translated into a different format.</p>


<h3 id="export-defs-def-begin">export-defs-def-begin</h3>
<p>If the phrase <b><i>dashrep-yes-or-no-export-delimited-definitions</i></b> equals <b><i>yes</i></b> when the action <b><i>write-all-dashrep-definitions-to-file</i></b> or the action <b><i>write-all-dashrep-phrase-names-to-file</i></b> or the action <b><i>write-dashrep-definitions-listed-in-phrase-to-file</i></b> action is used, this phrase name (enclosed in brackets) is inserted at the beginning of each definition.&nbsp; (A separate phrase is inserted at the end of the phrase name).&nbsp; This capability is useful if the written definitions need to be translated into a different format.</p>


<h3 id="export-defs-def-end">export-defs-def-end</h3>
<p>If the phrase <b><i>dashrep-yes-or-no-export-delimited-definitions</i></b> equals <b><i>yes</i></b> when the <b><i>write-all-dashrep-definitions-to-file</i></b> or <b><i>write-all-dashrep-phrase-names-to-file</i></b> or <b><i>write-dashrep-definitions-listed-in-phrase-to-file</i></b> action is used, this phrase name (enclosed in brackets) is inserted at the end of each definition.&nbsp; (A separate phrase is inserted at the beginning of the phrase name).&nbsp; This capability is useful if the written definitions need to be translated into a different format.</p>


<h3 id="export-defs-phrase-begin">export-defs-phrase-begin</h3>
<p>If the phrase <b><i>dashrep-yes-or-no-export-delimited-definitions</i></b> equals <b><i>yes</i></b> when the <b><i>write-all-dashrep-definitions-to-file</i></b> or <b><i>write-all-dashrep-phrase-names-to-file</i></b> or <b><i>write-dashrep-definitions-listed-in-phrase-to-file</i></b> action is used, this phrase name (enclosed in brackets) is inserted at the beginning of each phrase name.&nbsp; (A separate phrase is inserted at the end of the definition).&nbsp; This capability is useful if the written definitions need to be translated into a different format.</p>


<h3 id="export-defs-phrase-end">export-defs-phrase-end</h3>
<p>If the phrase <b><i>dashrep-yes-or-no-export-delimited-definitions</i></b> equals <b><i>yes</i></b> when the <b><i>write-all-dashrep-definitions-to-file</i></b> or <b><i>write-all-dashrep-phrase-names-to-file</i></b> or <b><i>write-dashrep-definitions-listed-in-phrase-to-file</i></b> action is used, this phrase name (enclosed in brackets) is inserted at the end of each phrase name.&nbsp; (A separate phrase is inserted at the beginning of the definition).&nbsp; This capability is useful if the written definitions need to be translated into a different format.</p>


<h3 id="delete-all-dashrep-phrases">delete-all-dashrep-phrases</h3>
<p>This action deletes all the definitions of all the phrases.&nbsp; Specifically, this action resets (undefines) every definition of every phrase, except the phrases that are defined internally.&nbsp; If the phrase <b><i>undeleted-phrase</i></b> exists and contains at least one non-space character, the contents of this special phrase is restored after all the phrases have been deleted.&nbsp; The phrase <b><i>undeleted-phrase</i></b> is useful for holding instructions that need to be executed after this action has deleted all other phrases.</p>


<h3 id="undeleted-phrase">undeleted-phrase</h3>
<p>See the action <b><i>delete-all-dashrep-phrases</i></b> for details.</p>


<h3 id="yes-or-no-expand-special-phrases">yes-or-no-expand-special-phrases</h3>
<p>If this phrase equals <b><i>no</i></b> then the following special phrases are not handled: <b><i>non-breaking-space</i></b>, <b><i>tab-here</i></b>, <b><i>empty-line</i></b>, <b><i>new-line</i></b>, <b><i>no-space</i></b>, and <b><i>one-space</i></b>.&nbsp; Any other value causes these special phrases to be handled.&nbsp; The default value is <b><i>yes</i></b>.</p>


<h3 id="insert-angle-bracketed-definitions">insert-angle-bracketed-definitions</h3>
<p>This action modifies the specified phrase by replacing each occurrence of a specially identified hyphenated phrase with the definition of that phrase.&nbsp; The specially identified hyphenated phrases begin and end with angle brackets (<b><i>&lt;</i></b> and <b><i>&gt;</i></b>) and contain at least one underscore (<b><i>_</i></b>), such as <b><i>&lt;special_content&gt;</i></b>.&nbsp; For each such specially identified hyphenated phrase, the underscores are replaced with hyphens, and if the resulting hyphenated phrase has a definition, then that definition is inserted in place of the specially identified hyphenated phrase.&nbsp; The special text <b><i>&lt;character_hyphen&gt;</i></b> is replaced by a hyphen (<b><i>-</i></b>) and is especially useful for handling text that contains Dashrep phrases that must not be replaced.&nbsp; The special text items <b><i>&lt;no_space&gt;</i></b> and <b><i>&lt;new_line&gt;</i></b> provide functionality that is equivalent to the <b><i>no-space</i></b> and <b><i>new-line</i></b> directives.</p>


<h3 id="dashrep-debug-trace-log">dashrep-debug-trace-log</h3>
<p>This phrase contains the "trace" messages that are written when "trace" and warning messages are requested.&nbsp; This information is useful for debugging.&nbsp; This phrase should be used on a read-only basis, although it can be cleared to remove messages that are not of interest.</p>


<h3 id="dashrep-debug-trace-on-yes-or-no">dashrep-debug-trace-on-yes-or-no</h3>
<p>If this phrase equals <b><i>yes</i></b> then trace messages are added to the trace log.&nbsp; Any other value causes silence when a trace message would otherwise be written.</p>


<h3 id="dashrep-recent-phrase-name-replaced">dashrep-recent-phrase-name-replaced</h3>
<p>This phrase contains the most recently replaced phrase name that was replaced when it appeared in parameter brackets.&nbsp; This phrase definition is useful for debugging by showing its definition at the beginning of the replaced phrase.</p>


<h3 id="dashrep-warning-trace-on-yes-or-no">dashrep-warning-trace-on-yes-or-no</h3>
<p>If this phrase equals <b><i>yes</i></b>, then warning messages are written to the phrase <b><i>dashrep-debug-trace-log</i></b>, and if this phrase equals <b><i>no</i></b> (or any other value), warning messages are not written.</p>


<h3 id="dashrep-action-trace-on-yes-or-no">dashrep-action-trace-on-yes-or-no</h3>
<p>If this phrase equals <b><i>yes</i></b> then each encountered action adds a message to the trace log to indicate which action occurred.&nbsp; Any other value causes silence when each encountered action is handled.&nbsp; For some actions, additional information about the action is included.</p>


<h3 id="dashrep-list-of-action-names">dashrep-list-of-action-names</h3>
<p>This phrase contains a list of all the Dashrep action names.</p>


<h3 id="dashrep-list-of-predefined-phrases">dashrep-list-of-predefined-phrases</h3>
<p>This phrase contains a list of all the phrases that are initialized or predefined by the Dashrep engine.</p>


<h3 id="dashrep-list-of-special-phrases">dashrep-list-of-special-phrases</h3>
<p>This phrase contains a list of all the phrases that Dashrep recognizes, but which are not action names and not predefined.</p>


<h3 id="dashrep-stop-translation">dashrep-stop-translation</h3>
<p>If this phrase is <b><i>yes</i></b> then the Dashrep translation process is stopped, which causes an exit from the Dashrep engine.&nbsp; If this phrase contains anything other than <b><i>yes</i></b> then the Dashrep translation process continues.</p>


<h3 id="escape-from-dashrep">escape-from-dashrep</h3>
<p>This action saves a copy of the current replacement results &mdash; in the phrase <b><i>dashrep-replacement-results-at-time-of-escape</i></b> &mdash; and exits the Dashrep engine.&nbsp; The Dashrep translation process can be resumed using the action <b><i>resume-after-escape-from-dashrep</i></b>.&nbsp; This action is intended for running software that is written in a different coding language, which makes this action useful for implementing <b><i>make</i></b> files and batch scripts, and for accessing a SQL database (with a query that is generated by expanding a template phrase).&nbsp; This action also can be used for debugging, in which case this action serves as a breakpoint.</p>


<h3 id="resume-after-escape-from-dashrep">resume-after-escape-from-dashrep</h3>
<p>This action resumes (restarts) the Dashrep translation process using the contents of the phrase <b><i>dashrep-replacement-results-at-time-of-escape</i></b> as the starting point.&nbsp; Typically this action is invoked from Perl code outside the Dashrep engine, after the action <b><i>escape-from-dashrep</i></b> was used.&nbsp; This action is useful after running software that is written in a different coding language, which makes this action &mdash; and the action <b><i>escape-from-dashrep</i></b> &mdash; useful for implementing <b><i>make</i></b> files and batch scripts.</p>


<h3 id="dashrep-replacement-results-at-time-of-escape">dashrep-replacement-results-at-time-of-escape</h3>
<p>This special phrase is used by the actions <b><i>escape-from-dashrep</i></b> and <b><i>resume-after-escape-from-dashrep</i></b>.&nbsp; This phrase can be viewed (outside of the Dashrep code) for debugging purposes, in which case the first-encountered occurrence of the action <b><i>escape-from-dashrep</i></b> serves as a breakpoint.</p>


<h3 id="use-handler-with-each-word-in-phrase-currently-at-character-position">use-handler-with-each-word-in-phrase-currently-at-character-position</h3>
<p>This action is for internal use only.&nbsp; It should not be used.</p>


<h3 id="convert-from-spoken-dashrep-code">convert-from-spoken-dashrep-code</h3>
<p>This action copies the definition of the first phrase into the definition of the second phrase, but recognizes and translates Dashrep spoken words.&nbsp; Specifically the words <b><i>fen</i></b> <b><i>dashbee</i></b> <b><i>dashenn</i></b> <b><i>dashnex</i></b> <b><i>ambee</i></b> <b><i>amenn</i></b> <b><i>combee</i></b> <b><i>comenn</i></b> <b><i>fenambee</i></b> <b><i>amennfen</i></b> <b><i>linbray</i></b> are translated.</p>


<h3 id="convert-into-spoken-dashrep-code">convert-into-spoken-dashrep-code</h3>
<p>This action copies the definition of first phrase into the definition of the second phrase, but Dashrep-special characters are translated into Dashrep spoken words.&nbsp; Specifically the words <b><i>fen</i></b> <b><i>dashbee</i></b> <b><i>dashenn</i></b> <b><i>dashnex</i></b> <b><i>ambee</i></b> <b><i>amenn</i></b> <b><i>combee</i></b> <b><i>comenn</i></b> <b><i>fenambee</i></b> <b><i>amennfen</i></b> <b><i>linbray</i></b> are inserted where appropriate.</p>


<h3 id="dashrep-endless-loop-count">dashrep-endless-loop-count</h3>
<p>This action supplies the current value of the internal endless-loop counter.&nbsp; This special action, which has no operands, supplies the count on a read-only basis.</p>


<h3 id="get-phrase-definition-without-expanding">get-phrase-definition-without-expanding</h3>
<p>This action inserts the definition of the specified phrase.&nbsp; This action is rarely needed.&nbsp; It provides a way to immediately expand a phrase by just one level of recursion, without also expanding parameter phrases within the definition.</p>


<h3 id="write-all-dashrep-definitions-to-file">write-all-dashrep-definitions-to-file</h3>
<p>This action writes all the Dashrep definitions to a new file with the specified file name, and erases the file if it already exists.&nbsp; By default the definitions are written in Dashrep-readable format, which means the phrase being defined appears first, then is followed by the definition, and multiple dashes terminate the definition.&nbsp; If the <b><i>dashrep-yes-or-no-export-delimited-definitions</i></b> phrase is set to <i>yes</i> , the exported definitions are delimited by the following phrases at appropriate positions: <b><i>export-defs-all-begin</i></b> , <b><i>export-defs-all-end</i></b> , <b><i>export-defs-phrase-begin</i></b> , <b><i>export-defs-phrase-end</i></b> , <b><i>export-defs-def-begin</i></b> , and <b><i>export-defs-def-end</i></b>.&nbsp; This special format allows a separate Dashrep translation to convert the written definitions into code such as HTML, XML, or SQL.&nbsp; The location of the target file is specified by the phrase <b><i>dashrep-path-prefix-for-file-writing</i></b>.</p>


<h3 id="yes-or-no-use-slower-subset-expand">yes-or-no-use-slower-subset-expand</h3>
<p>If this phrase equals <b><i>yes</i></b> then older and slower code is used to do expansions.&nbsp; Any other value causes the newer and faster expansion code to be used.</p>


<h3 id="unique-value">unique-value</h3>
<p>This special phrase contains a unique value each time this phrase appears in parameter brackets.&nbsp; Currently this action simply supplies a number that is incremented, but future versions may use non-sequential numbers (to accomodate parallel processing).</p>


<h3 id="yes-or-no-word-is-in-phrase">yes-or-no-word-is-in-phrase</h3>
<p>This action supplies <b><i>yes</i></b> if the following first word is one of the words in the following phrase, and supplies <b><i>no</i></b> otherwise. If the first word is a phrase name in parameter brackets and that phrase is empty, then a warning is put into the trace information because the number of operands is not two.&nbsp; A match does not occur if the word is contained within a longer word, or if the word is not isolated by spaces. </p> <p> Example: If the first operand is the word <b><i>dolphin</i></b> and the second phrase contains <b><i>dolphin tuna</i></b> then the result is <b><i>yes</i></b>. </p> <p> Example: If the first operand is the word <b><i>dolphin</i></b> and the second phrase contains <b><i>dolphin-oriented</i></b> then the result is <b><i>no</i></b>.</p>


<h3 id="copy-to-phrase-from-following-text">copy-to-phrase-from-following-text</h3>
<p></p>


<h3 id="dashrep-first-xml-tag-name">dashrep-first-xml-tag-name</h3>
<p>This phrase will no longer be recognized when the deprecated subroutine <b><i>dashrep_xml_tags_to_dashrep</i></b> has been removed.</p>


<h3 id="dashrep-xml-level-reset-if-zero">dashrep-xml-level-reset-if-zero</h3>
<p>This phrase will no longer be recognized when the deprecated subroutine <b><i>dashrep_xml_tags_to_dashrep</i></b> has been removed.</p>


<h3 id="dashrep-xml-trace-on-yes-or-no">dashrep-xml-trace-on-yes-or-no</h3>
<p>This phrase will no longer be recognized when the deprecated subroutine <b><i>dashrep_xml_tags_to_dashrep</i></b> has been removed.</p>


<h3 id="dashrep-xml-yes-ignore-if-no-tag-replacement">dashrep-xml-yes-ignore-if-no-tag-replacement</h3>
<p>This phrase will no longer be recognized when the deprecated subroutine <b><i>dashrep_xml_tags_to_dashrep</i></b> has been removed.</p>
