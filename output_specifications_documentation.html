<h2> Fundamental characters &amp; strings </h2> <table>
<tr><th>Normal <br \> priority</th><th>Name</th><th>Appearance</th><th>Description</th></tr>
<tr><td>1</td><td>Comment</td><td><b><i>*---&nbsp;</i></b> comment here &nbsp; <b><i>---*</i></b></td><td>Comments are ignored.&nbsp; The <b><i>*---</i></b> string indicates the beginning of a comment, and the <b><i>---*</i></b> string indicates the end of the comment.&nbsp; Comments cannot be nested; if they are, the results are unpredictable.&nbsp; The comment directives are not recognized if they appear within parameter brackets.</td></tr>
<tr><td>1</td><td>Comment</td><td><b><i>/---&nbsp;</i></b> comment here &nbsp; <b><i>---/</i></b></td><td>Alternate written way to indicate a comment.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Comment</td><td><b><i>comment-begin</i></b> comment here <b><i>comment-end</i></b></td><td>An alternate way &mdash; that is speakable &mdash; to insert a comment.&nbsp; The <b><i>comment-begin</i></b> phrase indicates the beginning of a comment, and the <b><i>comment-end</i></b> phrase indicates the end of the comment.&nbsp; Comments cannot be nested.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Space</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td>Each space is significant as a delimiter for hyphenated phrases and words (without hyphens).</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Three or more adjacent hyphens</td><td><b><i>----</i></b></td><td>Indicates the end of a definition, in a situation where a hyphenated phrase is defined using the <b><i>dashrep-definitions-begin</i></b> directive (or the equivalent).</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Parameter</td><td><b><i>[-</i></b> &nbsp; parameter &nbsp; <b><i>-]</i></b></td><td>A parameter is expanded before the surrounding text is expanded.&nbsp; The first-encountered innermost parameter is expanded first.&nbsp; Spaces at the beginning and end of the parameter are removed, which allows the expanded text to become part of a hyphenated phrase, which in turn enables branching and indexing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Assignment</td><td><b><i>[-</i></b> user-phrase-name <b><i>=</i></b> new text <b><i>-]</i></b></td><td>If a parameter contains an equal sign (=) and there is one hyphenated phrase between the equal sign and the beginning of the parameter, the text to the right of the equal sign (up to the end of the parameter) is assigned as the definition of the phrase.&nbsp; If the hyphenated phrase already had a definition, that definition is discarded.&nbsp; If the text between the beginning of a parameter and an equal sign is not one hyphenated phrase, the equal sign is not recognized as being part of an assignment.&nbsp; The assignment capability enables the same phrase to produce different results, which is what a "function" does in traditional programming languages.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Phrase name in parameter brackets</td><td><b><i>[-</i></b> user-phrase-name <b><i>-]</i></b></td><td>A hyphenated phrase within parameter brackets is expanded according to the phrase's definition (which itself can contain parameters).&nbsp; If the phrase name is not defined, it is left as-is, and the parameter brackets are removed.&nbsp; Spaces at the beginning and end of the parameter are removed, which allows the expanded text to become part of a hyphenated phrase, which in turn enables branching and indexing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Action</td><td><b><i>[-</i></b> zero-one-multiple 3 <b><i>-]</i></b></td><td>If the first (left-most) hyphenated phrase inside a parameter is one of the recognized actions (listed below), and the action is followed by text that the action knows how to handle, the action is performed.&nbsp; Some actions produce text that becomes the replacement for the parameter, whereas other actions operate on phrases or files and do not produce any text.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Hyphenated phrase</td><td>needed-text-string</td><td>A hyphen surrounded by non-space characters (and also excluding square brackets) is recognized as a hyphenated phrase.&nbsp; (A hyphen and a dash are different names for the same symbol.)&nbsp; A phrase name is case-sensitive.&nbsp; Lowercase-only names are recommended, but not required.&nbsp; Speakable names are recommended, but not required.&nbsp; The use of nouns before, rather than after, adjectives is recommended; this convention (for example <b><i>rectangle-large-begin</i></b> instead of <b><i>large-rectangle-begin</i></b>) is typical of many spoken languages, but not English.&nbsp; The first character cannot be a hyphen and cannot be a digit.&nbsp; The last character cannot be a hyphen.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Colon</td><td>needed-text-string<b><i>:</i></b> definition here &nbsp; <b><i>----</i></b></td><td>When there is text after the <b><i>dashrep-definitions-begin</i></b> directive, a colon can appear at the end of the phrase being defined.&nbsp; This convention is optional.&nbsp; It offers the advantage of making it easier to search for where a hyphenated phrase is defined, without also finding each place it is used.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>New line or line break</td><td>one line <b><i>line-break</i></b> next line</td><td>When a new line begins, it is replaced with a space.&nbsp; When a new line needs to be inserted into the resulting text, the new-line phrase (explained below) can be used.&nbsp; If a line break in the target language (such as HTML) is needed, the phrase line-break can be used to insert the appropriate target-specific code (which in HTML is the <b><i><br \></i></b> tag).</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Undefined hyphenated phrase</td><td>quite-talkative parrot</td><td>If a hyphenated phrase has not been defined, it is not translated; it remains unchanged.&nbsp; If a hyphenated phrase has been defined and is now empty, the hyphenated phrase will disapper.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>define-begin</td><td><b><i>define-begin</i></b></td><td>Explained below.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>dashrep-definitions-begin</td><td><b><i>dashrep-definitions-begin</i></b></td><td>Explained below.</td></tr>

<h2> Dashrep spoken words </h2> <table>
<tr><th>Word</th><th>Equivalence</th><th>Description</th></tr>
<tr><td>combee</td><td>*---</td><td>Indicates the beginning of a comment.</td></tr>
<tr><td>comenn</td><td>---*</td><td>Indicates the end of a comment.</td></tr>
<tr><td>fen</td><td>hyphen with no adjacent spaces</td><td>Inserts a hyphen between words (or other adjacent characters).</td></tr>
<tr><td>dashbee</td><td>(no equivalence)</td><td>Indicates the beginning of a phrase that needs to be hyphenated.&nbsp; For example, <b><i>dashbee words of phrase dashenn</i></b> becomes <b><i>words-of-phrase</i></b>.</td></tr>
<tr><td>dashenn</td><td>(no equivalence)</td><td>Indicates the end of a phrase that needs to be hyphenated.</td></tr>
<tr><td>dashnex</td><td>(no equivalence)</td><td>Indicates the end of one phrase that needs to be hyphenated and the beginning of another phrase that needs to be hyphenated.&nbsp; For example, <b><i>dashbee words of phrase dashnex words of another phrase dashenn</i></b> becomes <b><i>words-of-phrase words-of-another-phrase</i></b>.</td></tr>
<tr><td>ambee</td><td>[-</td><td>Indicates the beginning of a parameter.</td></tr>
<tr><td>amenn</td><td>-]</td><td>Indicates the end of a parameter.</td></tr>
<tr><td>ofo</td><td>(no equivalence)</td><td>Indicates that an operand (for an action) follows, and that the words (up to the next <b><i>ofo</i></b> or <b><i>amenn</i></b>) should be hyphenated.</td></tr>
<tr><td>conambee</td><td>-[-</td><td>Indicates the continuation of a hyphenated phrase that includes a parameter as part of the phrase.&nbsp; For example, <b><i>info-for-dolphin-named conambee dolphin-name amencon</i></b> becomes <b><i>info-for-dolphin-named-leaper</i></b> if <b><i>dolphin-name</i></b> equals <b><i>leaper</i></b>.</td></tr>
<tr><td>amenncon</td><td>-]-</td><td>Indicates the end of a parameter that, when it is translated, becomes part of a hyphenated phrase.</td></tr>
<tr><td>linbray</td><td>(line break)</td><td>Indicates that a line break should be inserted here.&nbsp; If the resulting text goes through additional translation steps, the inserted line break is likely to be converted into a space (rather than remaining as a line break).</td></tr>

<h2> Directives versus actions versus phrases </h2> <h3> Phrase </h3> <p> A <b>phrase</b> is a hyphenated phrase that has a definition, and the definition is inserted in place of the hyphenated phrase.&nbsp; Phrases are recognized regardless of whether or not they appear within parameter brackets. </p> <h3> Directive </h3> <p> A <b>directive</b> is a hyphenated phrase that triggers a special functionality in the translation.&nbsp; Directives are not recognized if they appear within parameter brackets. </p> <h3> Action </h3> <p> An <b>action</b> is a hyphenated phrase that has special significance when it appears at the beginning of text that is enclosed by parameter brackets.&nbsp; An action is not recognized if it is not within parameter brackets, or if it is not the first hyphenated phrase in the parameter brackets. </p><h2>Hyphens, spaces, lines, & square brackets</h2>


<h3 id="hyphen-here">hyphen-here</h3>
<p>A directive that inserts a hyphen, with no adjacent spaces.&nbsp; Internally this phrase is defined as <b><i>no-space - no-space</i></b>.</p>


<h3 id="character-hyphen">character-hyphen</h3>
<p>A phrase that contains one hyphen character (<b><i>-</i></b>).</p>


<h3 id="four-hyphens">four-hyphens</h3>
<p>A phrase that contains four adjacent hyphen characters (<b><i>----</i></b>).</p>


<h3 id="no-space">no-space</h3>
<p>A directive that removes any spaces (concatenation) after all other phrases have been replaced.&nbsp; If the <b><i>one-space</i></b> directive is adjacent, the <b><i>no-space</i></b> directive is ignored.</p>


<h3 id="empty-text">empty-text</h3>
<p>A pre-defined phrase that contains no text.&nbsp; It is useful with the action <b><i>copy-from-phrase-to-phrase-and-replace-string-in-phrase-with-phrase</i></b>.&nbsp; To clear a phrase, use the action <b><i>clear-phrase</i></b>.&nbsp; To test whether a phrase's definition is empty, use the action <b><i>yes-or-no-empty-phrase</i></b>.</p>


<h3 id="one-space">one-space</h3>
<p>A directive that inserts a single space.&nbsp; If the <b><i>no-space</i></b> directive is adjacent, the <b><i>no-space</i></b> directive is ignored.&nbsp; Repeating this directive does not insert multiple adjacent spaces, just a single space.&nbsp; If multiple spaces are needed, a phrase such as <b><i>four-spaces</i></b> can be defined as multiple spaces, and then those spaces will be inserted where the string <b><i><four_spaces></i></b> appears.</p>


<h3 id="character-space">character-space</h3>
<p>A phrase that contains one space character.&nbsp; This phrase is useful when using the action <b><i>copy-from-phrase-to-phrase-and-replace-string-in-phrase-with-phrase</i></b>.</p>


<h3 id="non-breaking-space">non-breaking-space</h3>
<p>A directive that inserts a single space &mdash; as defined in a target language.&nbsp; This string is inserted even if the <b><i>no-space</i></b> directive is adjacent.&nbsp; The default, which is intended for use in HTML, is <b><i>&amp;nbsp;</i></b>.</p>


<h3 id="new-line">new-line</h3>
<p>A directive that inserts a <b><i>newline</i></b> character, which specifies the start of a new line.&nbsp; If the target language, such as HTML, ignores line breaks, the line break will not be visible in the displayed result.</p>


<h3 id="empty-line">empty-line</h3>
<p>A directive that specifies an empty line, which is equivalent to two adjacent <b><i>new-line</i></b> directives.</p>


<h3 id="line-break">line-break</h3>
<p>A phrase that should be defined as a text string that, in turn, specifies a line break in the target language.&nbsp; For example, if the target language is HTML, normally this phrase would be defined as <b><i>&lt;br&nbsp;/&gt;</i></b>.</p>


<h3 id="character-newline">character-newline</h3>
<p>A phrase that contains a newline character.&nbsp; In some other programming languages this character is represented by the string <b>\<i>n</i></b>.</p>


<h3 id="character-open-square-bracket">character-open-square-bracket</h3>
<p>A phrase that contains the open-square-bracket character (<b>[</b>).</p>


<h3 id="character-close-square-bracket">character-close-square-bracket</h3>
<p>A phrase that contains the close-square-bracket character (<b>]</b>).</p>


<h3 id="character-tab">character-tab</h3>
<p>A phrase that contains a tab character.&nbsp; In some other programming languages this character is represented by the string <b>\<i>t</i></b>.</p>


<h3 id="delayed-nospace">delayed-nospace</h3>
<p>This phrase is not defined, but this name is reserved for use as a placeholder where the phrase <b><i>no-space</i></b> needs to be inserted later, after other replacements have been done.&nbsp; When ready, this phrase should be defined as <b><i>no-space</i></b> just before the final translation step.</p>


<h3 id="delayed-newline">delayed-newline</h3>
<p>This phrase is not defined, but this name is reserved for use as a placeholder where the phrase <b><i>new-line</i></b> needs to be inserted later, after other replacements have been done.&nbsp; When ready, this phrase should be defined as <b><i>new-line</i></b> just before the final translation step.</p>


<h2>Definition-related phrases</h2>


<h3 id="list-of-phrases-newly-defined">list-of-phrases-newly-defined</h3>
<p>A phrase that contains a list of all the hyphenated phrases that have been imported or defined.&nbsp; This definition can be cleared to limit the list to phrases that were imported or defined after the definition was cleared.</p>


<h3 id="dashrep-definitions-begin">dashrep-definitions-begin</h3>
<p>A directive that specifies that the text that follows are phrases and definitions.&nbsp; This phrase cannot be nested.&nbsp; This change continues until the phrase <b><i>dashrep-definitions-end</i></b> is encountered.</p>


<h3 id="dashrep-definitions-end">dashrep-definitions-end</h3>
<p>A directive that specifies the end of phrases and definitions that began with the directive <b><i>dashrep-definitions-begin</i></b>.</p>


<h3 id="dashrep-definition-append-next">dashrep-definition-append-next</h3>
<p>This directive requests that the next definition be appended to the existing definition of the specified phrase.&nbsp; This directive allows a list to be created during the reading of definitions because it overrides the normal convention of replacing the existing definition (when the same phrase name is defined more than once).</p>


<h3 id="define-end">define-end</h3>
<p>A directive that functions the same as several hyphens (<b><i>----</i></b>) at the end of a definition.&nbsp; It is provided as a speakable alternative for ending a definition.</p>


<h3 id="define-begin">define-begin</h3>
<p>This directive is ignored, but is defined for symmetry so that it can be used after the directive <b><i>define-end</i></b>.&nbsp; It is not needed because the context already determines where a definition begins.</p>


<h3 id="clear-phrase">clear-phrase</h3>
<p>An action that clears the definition for the specified phrase.&nbsp; This action is equivalent to using the equal-sign notation without any text for the new definition.</p>


<h3 id="clear-phrases-listed-in-phrase">clear-phrases-listed-in-phrase</h3>
<p>An action that clears the definitions for the phrases that are named in the specified phrase.</p>


<h3 id="clear-all-dashrep-phrases">clear-all-dashrep-phrases</h3>
<p>An action that clears all the definitions of all the phrases.&nbsp; Remember that this action resets every definition of every phrase, except the phrases that are defined internally.</p>


<h3 id="delete-phrases-listed-in-phrase">delete-phrases-listed-in-phrase</h3>
<p>An action that deletes (removes) the phrases that are named in the specified phrase.&nbsp; This phrase is related to the action <b><i>clear-phrases-listed-in-phrase</i></b> except that instead of just clearing the definition, this delete version removes (deletes) the phrase so that it will not be recognized.&nbsp; This action is useful for creating a template in which the listed phrases will be replaced by varying definitions at later times.</p>


<h3 id="copy-from-phrase-to-phrase">copy-from-phrase-to-phrase</h3>
<p>An action that copies the definition of the first hyphenated phrase into the definition of the second hyphenated phrase.&nbsp; This action must be followed by two phrase names, not one.&nbsp; The previous definition of the second hyphenated phrase is deleted.&nbsp; This action is useful in situations where the text includes hyphens, line breaks, multiple adjacent spaces and any other text that cannot be assigned using the equal-sign approach.</p>


<h3 id="copy-to-phrase-from-following-text">copy-to-phrase-from-following-text</h3>
<p>An action that copies into the first hyphenated phrase the text that follows the first hyphenated phrase, up to the end of the parameter brackets.&nbsp; The text can contain hyphens if they are not adjacent to an open angle bracket or close angle bracket.&nbsp; Trailing spaces and trailing hyphens are ignored.&nbsp; This action is useful in situations where a phrase name is needed, but that phrase name must not be expanded yet.</p>


<h3 id="append-from-phrase-to-phrase">append-from-phrase-to-phrase</h3>
<p>An action that appends the definition of the first phrase to the end of the definition of the second phrase, and inserts a single space between the existing text and the appended text.&nbsp; The two phrase names can be the same.</p>


<h3 id="append-from-phrase-to-phrase-no-space">append-from-phrase-to-phrase-no-space</h3>
<p>An action that appends the definition of the first phrase to the end of the definition of the second phrase, without inserting a separating space.&nbsp; The two phrase names can be the same.</p>


<h3 id="prepend-from-phrase-to-phrase">prepend-from-phrase-to-phrase</h3>
<p>An action that prepends the definition of the first phrase into the beginning of the definition of the second phrase, without inserting a separating space.</p>


<h3 id="prepend-from-phrase-to-phrase-no-space">prepend-from-phrase-to-phrase-no-space</h3>
<p>An action that prepends the definition of the first phrase into the beginning of the definition of the second phrase, and inserts a single space between the prepended text and the existing text.</p>


<h3 id="append-new-line-to-phrase">append-new-line-to-phrase</h3>
<p>An action that appends a newline code to the end of a definition.</p>


<h3 id="insert-definition-of-phrase">insert-definition-of-phrase</h3>
<p>An action that inserts the definition of the specified phrase.&nbsp; This action provides a way to immediately expand a phrase by just one level of recursion, without also expanding parameter phrases within the definition.</p>


<h3 id="expand-phrase-to-phrase">expand-phrase-to-phrase</h3>
<p>An action that expands ("translates") the contents of the first phrase and puts the results into the second phrase.&nbsp; This action provides a way to translate many different chunks of text rather than translating all text using the same translation choices.&nbsp; It is especially useful if the text contains hyphens but is not Dashrep code.</p>


<h3 id="expand-only-parameters-in-phrase-to-phrase">expand-only-parameters-in-phrase-to-phrase</h3>
<p>An action that expands ("translates") any parameters in the first phrase and puts the results into the second phrase.&nbsp; Unlike the related action <b><i>expand-phrase-to-phrase</i></b>, this action does not expand any phrases (except the starting named phrase) that appear outside of parameter brackets.&nbsp; This action is especially useful if there needs to be a delay in expanding the non-parameter phrases.</p>


<h3 id="copy-multiple-words-in-phrase-to-phrases-named-in-pattern">copy-multiple-words-in-phrase-to-phrases-named-in-pattern</h3>
<p>An action that copies multiple phrase definitions.&nbsp; Specifically space-delimited words in the first phrase are copied to multiple phrase names, where the phrase names have the pattern specified in the second phrase.&nbsp; The pattern must contain characters between the string <b><i>ambee-</i></b> (or <b><i>conambee-</i></b>) and the string <b><i>-amenn</i></b> (or <b><i>amenncon-</i></b>), and these characters must be the name of a phrase that contains the space-delimited words that will be inserted at that position within the pattern.&nbsp; If the phrase that contains the target word list contains only a string without any spaces (a single word), then only one item will be copied.&nbsp; If that list is empty, nothing will be copied.&nbsp; If the number of words in the first phrase is different from the number of words in the list that is specified within the pattern, the copying will stop when the shorter list is exhausted.&nbsp; As an example of this action, if the first phrase contains <b><i>dolphin buffalo bear</i></b>, and the secomd phrase contains <b><i>item-ambee-list-of-numbers-as-text-amenn</i></b>, and the phrase <b><i>list-of-numbers-as-text</i></b> contains the string <b><i>one two three</i></b>, then the phrase <b><i>item-one</i></b> will contain <b><i>dolphin</i></b> and the phrase <b><i>item-two</i></b> will contain <b><i>buffalo</i></b> and the phrase <b><i>item-three</i></b> will contain <b><i>bear</i></b>.&nbsp; This action is useful for copying a long list fast, without needing to use a separate Dashrep action for each item copied.</p>


<h3 id="append-multiple-from-phrases-named-in-pattern-to-phrase">append-multiple-from-phrases-named-in-pattern-to-phrase</h3>
<p>An action that appends multiple phrase definitions onto the end of the definition of the second phrase.&nbsp; The pattern for the multiple phrase names is specified in the first phrase.&nbsp; The pattern must contain characters between the string <b><i>ambee-</i></b> (or <b><i>conambee-</i></b>) and the string <b><i>-amenn</i></b> (or <b><i>amenncon-</i></b>), and these characters must be the name of a phrase that contains the space-delimited words that will be inserted at that position within the pattern.&nbsp; If the phrase that contains the word list contains only a string without any spaces (a single word), then only one item will be appended.&nbsp; If the list is empty, nothing will be appended.&nbsp; As an example of this action, if the first phrase contains the string <b><i>item-ambee-list-of-numbers-as-text-amenn</i></b> and the phrase <b><i>list-of-numbers-as-text</i></b> contains the string <b><i>one two three</i></b> and the second phrase already contains the string <b><i>dolphin</i></b> and the phrase <b><i>item-one</i></b> contains <b><i>buffalo</i></b> and the phrase <b><i>item-two</i></b> contains <b><i>bear</i></b> and the phrase <b><i>item-three</i></b> contains <b><i>eagle</i></b> then the second phrase will contain <b><i>dolphin buffalo bear eagle</i></b>.&nbsp; This action is useful for building a long list fast, without needing to use a separate Dashrep action for each item appended.</p>


<h3 id="dashrep-yes-append-not-replace-for-imported-phrases">dashrep-yes-append-not-replace-for-imported-phrases</h3>
<p>If this phrase equals <b><i>yes</i></b>, and if a phrase definition is being imported from a file, and if that phrase has the same name as an existing phrase, then the definition is appended to the end of the existing definition, rather than replacing the existing definition.&nbsp; A space is inserted to separate the two definitions.&nbsp; This capability is useful when multiple files contain phrase definitions with the same names, and those definitions are lists that should be combined.</p>


<h3 id="dashrep-yes-or-no-export-delimited-definitions">dashrep-yes-or-no-export-delimited-definitions</h3>
<p>If this phrase equals <b><i>yes</i></b> then the action <b><i>write-all-dashrep-definitions-to-file</i></b> or the action <b><i>write-all-dashrep-phrase-names-to-file</i></b> or the action <b><i>write-dashrep-definitions-listed-in-phrase-to-file</i></b> action is used, this phrase name (enclosed in brackets) is inserted at the end of each phrase name.&nbsp; Otherwise exported definitions are written using the normal Dashrep convention.&nbsp; This capability enables the exported definitions to be converted into special formats such as HTML or XML.</p>


<h3 id="export-defs-all-begin">export-defs-all-begin</h3>
<p>If the phrase <b><i>dashrep-yes-or-no-export-delimited-definitions</i></b> equals <b><i>yes</i></b> when the action <b><i>write-all-dashrep-definitions-to-file</i></b> or the action <b><i>write-all-dashrep-phrase-names-to-file</i></b> or the action <b><i>write-dashrep-definitions-listed-in-phrase-to-file</i></b> is used, this phrase name (enclosed in brackets) is inserted at the beginning of all the written-to-a-file phrase definitions.&nbsp; This capability is useful if the written definitions need to be translated into a different format.</p>


<h3 id="export-defs-all-end">export-defs-all-end</h3>
<p>If the phrase <b><i>dashrep-yes-or-no-export-delimited-definitions</i></b> equals <b><i>yes</i></b> when the action <b><i>write-all-dashrep-definitions-to-file</i></b> or the action <b><i>write-all-dashrep-phrase-names-to-file</i></b> or the action <b><i>write-dashrep-definitions-listed-in-phrase-to-file</i></b> action is used, this phrase name (enclosed in brackets) is inserted at the end of all the written-to-a-file phrase definitions.&nbsp; This capability is useful if the written definitions need to be translated into a different format.</p>


<h3 id="export-defs-def-begin">export-defs-def-begin</h3>
<p>If the phrase <b><i>dashrep-yes-or-no-export-delimited-definitions</i></b> equals <b><i>yes</i></b> when the action <b><i>write-all-dashrep-definitions-to-file</i></b> or the action <b><i>write-all-dashrep-phrase-names-to-file</i></b> or the action <b><i>write-dashrep-definitions-listed-in-phrase-to-file</i></b> action is used, this phrase name (enclosed in brackets) is inserted at the beginning of each definition.&nbsp; (A separate phrase is inserted at the end of the phrase name).&nbsp; This capability is useful if the written definitions need to be translated into a different format.</p>


<h3 id="export-defs-def-end">export-defs-def-end</h3>
<p>If the phrase <b><i>dashrep-yes-or-no-export-delimited-definitions</i></b> equals <b><i>yes</i></b> when the <b><i>write-all-dashrep-definitions-to-file</i></b> or <b><i>write-all-dashrep-phrase-names-to-file</i></b> or <b><i>write-dashrep-definitions-listed-in-phrase-to-file</i></b> action is used, this phrase name (enclosed in brackets) is inserted at the end of each definition.&nbsp; (A separate phrase is inserted at the beginning of the phrase name).&nbsp; This capability is useful if the written definitions need to be translated into a different format.</p>


<h3 id="export-defs-phrase-begin">export-defs-phrase-begin</h3>
<p>If the phrase <b><i>dashrep-yes-or-no-export-delimited-definitions</i></b> equals <b><i>yes</i></b> when the <b><i>write-all-dashrep-definitions-to-file</i></b> or <b><i>write-all-dashrep-phrase-names-to-file</i></b> or <b><i>write-dashrep-definitions-listed-in-phrase-to-file</i></b> action is used, this phrase name (enclosed in brackets) is inserted at the beginning of each phrase name.&nbsp; (A separate phrase is inserted at the end of the definition).&nbsp; This capability is useful if the written definitions need to be translated into a different format.</p>


<h3 id="export-defs-phrase-end">export-defs-phrase-end</h3>
<p>If the phrase <b><i>dashrep-yes-or-no-export-delimited-definitions</i></b> equals <b><i>yes</i></b> when the <b><i>write-all-dashrep-definitions-to-file</i></b> or <b><i>write-all-dashrep-phrase-names-to-file</i></b> or <b><i>write-dashrep-definitions-listed-in-phrase-to-file</i></b> action is used, this phrase name (enclosed in brackets) is inserted at the end of each phrase name.&nbsp; (A separate phrase is inserted at the beginning of the definition).&nbsp; This capability is useful if the written definitions need to be translated into a different format.</p>


<h2>Decision-related phrases</h2>


<h3 id="if-yes-begin">if-yes-begin</h3>
<p>An action that looks at the first space-delimited word, and if it is <b><i>yes</i></b> (or contains that character string) then this action removes all the text between the next occurrences of <b><i>[-if-else-]</i></b> and <b><i>[-if-end-]</i></b> (and removes the <b><i>[-if-else-]</i></b> and <b><i>[-if-end-]</i></b> text strings).&nbsp; Otherwise (if the first word that follows does not contain <b><i>yes</i></b>) then this action removes all the text between itself (the action name) and the next occurrence of <b><i>[-if-else-]</i></b> (and removes the <b><i>[-if-else-]</i></b> and <b><i>[-if-end-]</i></b> text strings.&nbsp; This action provides a major branching capability.&nbsp; However, the <b><i>if-yes-begin</i></b> action and the <b><i>[-if-else-]</i></b> text string and the <b><i>[-if-end-]</i></b> text string <b>cannot</b> be nested (as allowed in most programming languages).&nbsp; If nested branching is needed, each level of branching must be done in a different phrase definition (which improves documentation if meaningful phrase names are used).</p>

<p>An action that copies the text in the first phrase into the second phrase but omits the last space-delimited word.&nbsp; The two phrase names can be the same.</p>


<h3 id="append-word-to-phrase">append-word-to-phrase</h3>
<p>An action that copies the first word onto the end of the definition of the second hyphenated phrase.&nbsp; Do not use this action if the first word might be empty because that causes an error (because the wrong number of operands are supplied).</p>


<h2>Loop-related (& list-related) phrases</h2>


<h3 id="use-handler-with-each-word-in-phrase">use-handler-with-each-word-in-phrase</h3>
<p>An action that expands the named handler (which is just a named phrase) multiple times, once for each word in the second phrase.&nbsp; Each time the handler is expanded, the phrase <b><i>word-to-use-in-handler</i></b> contains the next word.&nbsp; Nothing is supplied as a result.&nbsp; Instead, the handler needs to store any changes in specified phrases (or in specified files).&nbsp; The content in the second phrase must not change during the time this expansion is being done. </p> <p> Most commonly this action is used to generate a list, in which case the handler either appends text to a single phrase, or generates multiple new phrases (which are typically named using the content of the phrase <b><i>word-to-use-in-handler</i></b> as part of the phrase name). </p> <p> Internally this action just inserts a sequence of parameter phrases.&nbsp; For example, if the phrase <b><i>list-of-words</i></b> contains two words, the code <b><i>[-use-handler-with-each-word-in-phrase handler-name list-of-words-]</i></b> would generate (and insert) the code <b><i>[-copy-from-phrase-to-phrase-only-word-at-position list-of-words word-to-use-in-handler 1-][-handler-name-][-copy-from-phrase-to-phrase-only-word-at-position list-of-words word-to-use-in-handler 2-][-handler-name-]</i></b>.)</p>

<p>Generates a list of integers and puts them into the definition of the third phrase.&nbsp; The supplied integers indicate the starting and ending values.&nbsp; For example, <b><i>counts-from-integer-to-integer-put-into-phrase 1 10 one-to-ten</i></b> defines the phrase <b><i>one-to-ten</i></b> as <b><i>1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10</i></b>.</p>


<h3 id="create-list-of-phrase-names-that-begin-with-text-in-phrase-and-put-into-phrase">create-list-of-phrase-names-that-begin-with-text-in-phrase-and-put-into-phrase</h3>
<p>An action that looks at all the defined phrases and identifies the ones whose name begins with the text in the first phrase, and puts those phrase names into the second phrase, with a space between each phrase name.</p>


<h3 id="every-pairwise-combination-of-words-from-two-phrases-put-into-two-phrases">every-pairwise-combination-of-words-from-two-phrases-put-into-two-phrases</h3>
<p>An action that generates two word-based lists that are named according to the third phrase and the fourth phrase, where each pair of words is one possible combination of words listed in the first phrase and the second phrase.&nbsp; For example, if the first phrase contains <b><i>dolphin eagle bear</i></b> and the second phrase contains <b><i>leaps flies ambles</i></b> then the third phrase will contain <b><i>dolphin dolphin dolphin eagle eagle eagle bear bear bear</i></b> and the fourth phrase will contain <b><i>leaps flies ambles leaps flies ambles leaps flies ambles</i></b>.</p>

<h3 id="dashrep-phrase-suffix-for-imported-phrases">dashrep-phrase-suffix-for-imported-phrases</h3>
<p>A suffix that is placed at the end of each newly defined phrase imported from a file.&nbsp; See the phrase <b><i>prefix-for-imported-phrases</i></b> for more details.</p>


<h3 id="write-all-dashrep-definitions-to-file">write-all-dashrep-definitions-to-file</h3>
<p>Writes all the Dashrep definitions to a new file with the specified file name, and erases the file if it already exists.&nbsp; By default the definitions are written in Dashrep-readable format, which means the phrase being defined appears first, then is followed by the definition, and multiple dashes terminate the definition.&nbsp; If the <b><i></i></b> phrase is set to <i>yes</i> , the exported definitions are delimited by the following phrases at appropriate positions: <b><i>export-defs-all-begin</i></b> , <b><i>export-defs-all-end</i></b> , <b><i>export-defs-phrase-begin</i></b> , <b><i>export-defs-phrase-end</i></b> , <b><i>export-defs-def-begin</i></b> , and <b><i>export-defs-def-end</i></b>.&nbsp; This special format allows a separate Dashrep translation to convert the written definitions into code such as HTML, XML, or SQL.</p>


<h3 id="write-all-dashrep-phrase-names-to-file">write-all-dashrep-phrase-names-to-file</h3>
<p>Writes all the Dashrep phrase names to a new file with the specified file name, and erases the file if it already exists.&nbsp; For security purposes this action can be disabled.&nbsp; The location of the target file is specified by the phrase <b><i>dashrep-path-prefix-for-file-writing</i></b>.</p>

<p>Reads the specified file (named in the first phrase) and finds all the lines that begin with any of the words in the second phrase, and puts into the third phrase a list of hyphenated phrases that contain the matching lines.&nbsp; If none of the lines in the file begin with any two of the specified words, then the third phrase will be empty.&nbsp; A line is regarded as a match if the first two words are the same, and if that word is in the specified word list.&nbsp; The location of the file is specified by the phrase <b><i>dashrep-path-prefix-for-file-reading</i></b>.</p>


<h3 id="copy-from-columns-in-file-to-named-phrases">copy-from-columns-in-file-to-named-phrases</h3>
<p>Reads from the specified file all the spreadsheet-like lines of text, and puts each (space-delimited) word into a phrase that has a special name.&nbsp; The specified phrase must begin with the (space-delimited) prefix for all the names, is followed by the (space-delimited) name of each column.&nbsp; For example, if the second operand is a phrase that contains <b><i>cell-contents-for-nickname phone-number city state</i></b> and one line of text in the file is <b><i>flipper 123-456-7890 san-diego ca</i></b> then the phrase <b><i>cell-contents-for-nickname-flipper-phone-number</i></b> will contain <b><i>123-456-7890</i></b> and the phrase <b><i>cell-contents-for-nickname-flipper-city</i></b> will contain <b><i>san-diego</i></b> and the phrase <b><i>cell-contents-for-nickname-flipper-state</i></b> will contain <b><i>ca</i></b>.&nbsp; A third operand is the name of a phrase that will contain the list of unique values, where <b><i>flipper</i></b> is the unique value in this example, that come from the first word in each line.&nbsp; This action is useful for reading spreadsheet-like data.&nbsp; The phrase <b><i>dashrep-use-two-spaces-as-column-delimiter</i></b> can be useful if any spreadsheet-like cell of data contains any spaces.&nbsp; The filename is specified by the first operand, and the location of that file is specified in the phrase <b><i>dashrep-path-prefix-for-file-reading</i></b>.&nbsp; If a unique value is used more than once, the information in the last occurrence overwrites the earlier information.</p>


<h3 id="dashrep-use-two-spaces-as-column-delimiter">dashrep-use-two-spaces-as-column-delimiter</h3>
<p>Requests that the action <b><i>copy-from-columns-in-file-to-named-phrases</i></b> regards two adjacent spaces as the delimiter between words.&nbsp; Without this adjustment that action regards a single space as the delimiter between words.&nbsp; This adjustment enables the text in any column of (text) data to contain single spaces.&nbsp; This adjustment avoids the complications that arise from using a tab character as a column delimiter, such as in exported spreadsheet data.</p>


<h3 id="gather-tagged-info-from-file-and-put-unique-values-into-phrase">gather-tagged-info-from-file-and-put-unique-values-into-phrase</h3>
<p>Reads from the specified file all the lines in that text file, and creates phrase definitions that are based on the first word in each line.&nbsp; When the first word (of a line) matches the definition of the <b><i>dashrep-gather-tag-begin</i></b> phrase (which has a default value of <b><i>entry_begin</i></b> ), a new set of related items begins, and when the first word (of a line) matches the definition of the <b><i>dashrep-gather-tag-end</i></b> phrase (which has a default value of <b><i>entry_end</i></b> ), that set of items ends.&nbsp; When the first word (of a line) matches the definition of the <b><i>dashrep-gather-tag-unique</i></b> phrase (which has a default value of <b><i>url</i></b>, and which must appear within a set of items), the next (space-delimited) word in that line is used as the unique identifier for the items in that set.&nbsp; If the same unique identifier appears in a later set, the items in the new set overwrite the previous items that have the same identifier.&nbsp; Each generated phrase name begins with the tag name (that preceded that item) followed by the string <b><i>-value-for-unique-id-</i></b> and then followed by the unique value.&nbsp; The list of encountered unique values is put into the second-operand phrase. </p> <p> If the string <b><i>multi_line_begin</i></b> immediately follows an item's name, the lines that follow, up to a line that contains (only) <b><i>multi_line_end</i></b>, are combined (with a space between each line's content) into a long value for that named item. </p> <p> If a normal (non-multi) line begins with the definition of <b><i>dashrep-gather-tag-delete</i></b> phrase (which has a default value of <b><i>delete_id</i></b> ) then the unique value in the second word (of that line) is omitted from the list of encountered unique values.&nbsp; If a later entry specifies a definition for an entry that was requested to be deleted, the later entry overrides the deletion request.&nbsp; A deletion request does not delete any of the already-defined phrases, but those phrases will not be accessed if the created phrases are only accessed using the list of encountered unique values. </p> <p> This "gather" action is useful for accessing database-like text files where the first word in each line acts as the "field" name for a database record, and each set of items corresponds to one database record.&nbsp; This action is also useful for spreadsheet-like information where the tag names are analogous to single-word column titles, and one row of spreadsheet data is stored in multiple lines, with each cell's content on a separate (labelled) line.&nbsp; The order of the items within each set is not significant, and the order does not need to be the same from one set to another.&nbsp; This action does not require that each set of items use the same first words that are used in other sets, but in that case the generated phrases should be checked for undefined (empty) phrase definitions.&nbsp; The location of the (source) file is specified by the phrase <b><i>dashrep-path-prefix-for-file-reading</i></b>.</p>

<h2>XML-import phrases</h2>


<h3 id="xml-move-attributes-into-tag-elements-within-phrase">xml-move-attributes-into-tag-elements-within-phrase</h3>
<p>An action that moves the content of an <b><i>attribute</i></b> tag or a <b><i>specify</i></b> tag inside the preceding tag.&nbsp; For example, it converts the string <b><i>&lt;img /&gt;&lt;attribute href="image.jpg"&gt;&lt;attribute alt="image"&gt;</i></b> into the string <b><i>&lt;img href="image.jpg" alt="image" /&gt;</i></b>.&nbsp; The word <b><i>specify</i></b> can be used instead of <b><i>attribute</i></b>.&nbsp; This functionality is useful for generating XML and HTML code by using hyphenated phrases such as <b><i>image-here specify-href image.jpg specify-end specify-alt image specify-end</i></b> (instead of having to specify the nesting of the beginning and ending of a tag, such as <b><i>image-here-begin</i></b> and <b><i>image-here-end</i></b>).</p>

<p>If this user-defined phrase equals <b><i>yes</i></b>, then messages are written to the phrase <b><i>dashrep-debug-trace-log</i></b> during an XML translation, and if this phrase equals <b><i>no</i></b> (or any other value), those messages are not written.</p>


<h3 id="dashrep-xml-yes-ignore-if-no-tag-replacement">dashrep-xml-yes-ignore-if-no-tag-replacement</h3>
<p>If this user-defined phrase equals <b><i>yes</i></b> then XML translations ignore data that would be tagged with a hyphenated phrase that is not defined.&nbsp; For example, if the context for XML data is <b><i>&lt;xml&gt;&lt;dolphin&gt;&lt;firstname&gt;Flipper&lt;/firstname&gt;&lt;/dolphin&gt;&lt;/xml&gt;</i></b> and the phrase <b><i>xml-dolphin-firstname</i></b> has not been defined, then this XML data is ignored.&nbsp; The match is case sensitive, which means that a defined phrase of <b><i>XML-Dolphin-Firstname</i></b> would not be sufficient to capture the data in this example.</p>


<h2>HTML-output phrases</h2>


<h3 id="dashrep-html-replacement-ampersand">dashrep-html-replacement-ampersand</h3>
<p>A phrase that contains the text that is inserted as a replacement for the ampersand (&) character when the action <b><i>copy-from-phrase-to-phrase-and-replace-html-reserved-characters</i></b> is used.</p>


<h3 id="dashrep-html-replacement-apostrophe">dashrep-html-replacement-apostrophe</h3>
<p>A phrase that contains the text that is inserted as a replacement for the apostrophe (') character when the action <b><i>copy-from-phrase-to-phrase-and-replace-html-reserved-characters</i></b> is used.</p>


<h3 id="dashrep-html-replacement-close-angle-bracket">dashrep-html-replacement-close-angle-bracket</h3>
<p>A phrase that contains the text that is inserted as a replacement for the close angle bracket (&gt;) character when the action <b><i>copy-from-phrase-to-phrase-and-replace-html-reserved-characters</i></b> is used.</p>


<h3 id="dashrep-html-replacement-open-angle-bracket">dashrep-html-replacement-open-angle-bracket</h3>

<h3 id="dashrep-html-replacement-quotation-mark">dashrep-html-replacement-quotation-mark</h3>
<p>A phrase that contains the text that is inserted as a replacement for the ampersand (&) character when the action <b><i>copy-from-phrase-to-phrase-and-replace-html-reserved-characters</i></b> is used.</p>


<h3 id="insert-angle-bracketed-definitions-into-already-expanded-phrase">insert-angle-bracketed-definitions-into-already-expanded-phrase</h3>
<p>An action that modifies the specified phrase by replacing each occurrence of a specially identified hyphenated phrase with the definition of that phrase.&nbsp; the specially identified hyphenated phrases begin and end with angle brackets (<b><i>&lt;</i></b> and <b><i>&gt;</i></b>) and contain at least one underscore (<b><i>_</i></b>), such as <b><i>&lt;special_content&gt;</i></b>.&nbsp; For each such specially identified hyphenated phrase, the underscores are replaced with hyphens, and if the resulting hyphenated phrase has a definition, then that definition is inserted in place of the specially identified hyphenated phrase.&nbsp; The special string <b><i>&lt;character_hyphen&gt;</i></b> is replaced by a hyphen (<b><i>-</i></b>) and is especially useful for handling text that contains Dashrep phrases that must not be replaced.&nbsp; The special strings <b><i>&lt;no_space&gt;</i></b> and <b><i>&lt;new_line&gt;</i></b> provide functionality that is equivalent to the <b><i>no-space</i></b> and <b><i>new-line</i></b> directives.</p>

<p>A phrase that contains the "trace" messages that are written when "trace" and warning messages are requested.&nbsp; This information is useful for debugging.&nbsp; This phrase should be used on a read-only basis.</p>


<h3 id="dashrep-debug-trace-on-yes-or-no">dashrep-debug-trace-on-yes-or-no</h3>
<p>A <b><i>yes</i></b> value for this phrase requests that trace messages be added to the trace log, and a <b><i>no</i></b> value keeps silent when a trace message would otherwise be written.</p>


<h3 id="dashrep-trace-show-definition">dashrep-trace-show-definition</h3>
<p>A phrase that requests that the value of the specified phrase be indicated in the trace log.&nbsp; These requests are highlighted with multiple asterisks (<b><i>*******</i></b>).&nbsp; The requested information appears in the trace log regardless of whether the <b><i></i></b> definition is <b><i>yes</i></b> or <b><i>no</i></b>.</p>


<h3 id="dashrep-recent-phrase-name-replaced">dashrep-recent-phrase-name-replaced</h3>
<p>A phrase that contains the most recently replaced phrase name that was replaced when it appeared in parameter brackets.&nbsp; This phrase definition is useful for debugging by showing its definition at the beginning of the replaced phrase.</p>


<h3 id="dashrep-warning-trace-on-yes-or-no">dashrep-warning-trace-on-yes-or-no</h3>

<h3 id="dashrep-action-trace-on-yes-or-no">dashrep-action-trace-on-yes-or-no</h3>
<p>A <b><i>yes</i></b> value for this phrase requests that each encountered action add a message to the trace log to indicate which action occurred, and a <b><i>no</i></b> value keeps silent when each encountered action is handled.&nbsp; For some actions, additional information about the action is included.</p>


<h3 id="dashrep-linewise-trace-on-yes-or-no">dashrep-linewise-trace-on-yes-or-no</h3>
<p>A <b><i>yes</i></b> value for this phrase requests that <b><i>linewise</i></b> actions (which include the word <b><i>linewise</i></b>) add messages to the trace log to indicate what they are doing, and a <b><i>no</i></b> value keeps silent when linewise actions are handled.</p>


<h3 id="dashrep-web-framework-trace-on-yes-or-no">dashrep-web-framework-trace-on-yes-or-no</h3>
<p>If this user-defined phrase equals <b><i>yes</i></b>, then messages are written to the phrase <b><i>dashrep-debug-trace-log</i></b> during the processing doing in the web framework, and if this phrase equals <b><i>no</i></b> (or any other value), those messages are not written.</p>

<h3 id="dashrep-endless-loop-counter-limit">dashrep-endless-loop-counter-limit</h3>
<p>A user-defined phrase that specifies the maximum number of replacements allowed during a Dashrep translation.&nbsp; This number can be redefined such as to a larger number.&nbsp; If this limit is exceeded, Dashrep translation is stopped and an error message indicates which phrase was replaced the most number of times.&nbsp; If large amounts of data are processed, the default number is not going to be large enough.&nbsp; This limit interrupts endless loops, which can occur if a phrase is defined in a way that (either directly or indirectly) includes its own name.</p>


<h3 id="dashrep-endless-loop-count">dashrep-endless-loop-count</h3>
<p>An action that supplies the current value of the internal endless-loop counter.&nbsp; This special action, which has no operands, supplies the count on a read-only basis.</p>


<h3 id="insert-codeview-tags-into-phrase">insert-codeview-tags-into-phrase</h3>
<p>Inserts into the specified phrase definition special tags that enable the raw Dashrep code to be displayed, such as on a web page.&nbsp; The special inserted tags, such as <b><i>&lt;dashrep_codeview_action_begin&gt;</i></b> and <b><i>&lt;dashrep_codeview_action_middle_1&gt;</i></b>, are expected to be replaced by the strings in phrases such as <b><i>dashrep-codeview-action-begin</i></b> and <b><i>dashrep-codeview-action-middle-1</i></b>.</p>


<h3 id="end-of-line-here">end-of-line-here</h3>
<p>A phrase that is inserted at the end of each line when the actions <b><i>copy-from-file-to-phrase</i></b> or <b><i>copy-from-file-to-phrases-line-numbered</i></b> are used, and if the phrase <b><i>dashrep-yes-indicate-line-endings</i></b> equals <b><i>yes</i></b>.</p>


<h3 id="unique-value">unique-value</h3>
<p>A special phrase that contains a unique value each time this phrase appears in parameter brackets.&nbsp; Currently this action simply supplies a number that is incremented, but future versions may use non-sequential numbers (to accomodate parallel processing).</p>


<h3 id="dashrep-list-of-recognized-phrase-names">dashrep-list-of-recognized-phrase-names</h3>
<p>An action that gets at all the defined phrases, and puts those phrase names into the second phrase, with a space between each phrase name.&nbsp; For security purposes this action can be disabled.</p>


<h3 id="dashrep-yes-indicate-line-endings">dashrep-yes-indicate-line-endings</h3>
<p>If this phrase is defined as <b><i>yes</i></b>, the actions <b><i>copy-from-file-to-phrase</i></b> and <b><i>copy-from-file-to-phrases-line-numbered</i></b> insert the text <b><i>end-of-line-here</i></b> at line-break positions.&nbsp; The <b><i>end-of-line-here</i></b> phrase does not have a default definition.</p>


<h3 id="yes-or-no-use-faster-subset-expand">yes-or-no-use-faster-subset-expand</h3>
<p>If this phrase is defined as <b><i>yes</i></b>, a newer and faster section of code is used to expand Dashrep code (that does not contain parameter brackets).&nbsp; This code handles the directives <b><i>no-space</i></b> and <b><i>one-space</i></b> and <b><i>new-line</i></b> and <b><i>empty-line</i></b>.&nbsp; This code is useful for increasing the speed of a server response for a website.&nbsp; The original code is still available for uses that require handling all Dashrep conventions and that do not require fast execution times.</p>


<h3 id="dashrep-yes-do-not-expand-special-phrases">dashrep-yes-do-not-expand-special-phrases</h3>
<p>If this user-defined phrase equals <b><i>yes</i></b> then the following special phrases are not handled: <b><i>non-breaking-space</i></b>, <b><i>tab-here</i></b>, <b><i>empty-line</i></b>, <b><i>new-line</i></b>, <b><i>no-space</i></b>, and <b><i>one-space</i></b> .</p>


<h3 id="yes-or-no-allow-user-defined-actions">yes-or-no-allow-user-defined-actions</h3>
<p>If this phrase is <b><i>yes</i></b> then a user-defined phrase can be used as an action.&nbsp; Otherwise a user-defined action will not be recognized.&nbsp; When a user-defined action is encountered, the first four space-delimited words that follow the (hyphenated) action name become available as the definitions of the phrases <b><i>user-defined-action-operand-one</i></b>, <b><i>user-defined-action-operand-two</i></b>, <b><i>user-defined-action-operand-three</i></b>, and <b><i>user-defined-action-operand-four</i></b>.&nbsp; If user-defined actions are allowed, the actions do not need to be defined in any special way.&nbsp; A user-defined action is simply a hyphenated phrase that can immediately follow an opening parameter bracket (<b><i>[-</i></b>) and the hyphenated phrase can use the special operand phrase names to access the words that follow the user-defined action phrase (up to the closing parameter bracket ( <b><i>-]</i></b>).</p>


<h3 id="user-defined-action-operand-one">user-defined-action-operand-one</h3>
<p>See description of <b><i>yes-or-no-allow-user-defined-actions</i></b> for details.</p>

<h3 id="copy-from-phrase-to-phrase-into-spoken-dashrep-code">copy-from-phrase-to-phrase-into-spoken-dashrep-code</h3>
<p>An action that copies the definition of first phrase into the definition of the second phrase, but Dashrep-special characters are translated into Dashrep spoken words.&nbsp; Specifically the words <b><i>fen</i></b> <b><i>dashbee</i></b> <b><i>dashenn</i></b> <b><i>dashnex</i></b> <b><i>ambee</i></b> <b><i>amenn</i></b> <b><i>combee</i></b> <b><i>comenn</i></b> <b><i>conambee</i></b> <b><i>amenncon</i></b> <b><i>linbray</i></b> are inserted where appropriate.</p>
