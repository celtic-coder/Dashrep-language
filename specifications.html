<center><h1>Specifications for the Dashrep<font size="5">&trade;</font> language</h1></center>

<a name="goals"></a>
<h2>Dashrep design goals</h2>

<ul>

<li>Provide a convenient way to move data out of executable code.&nbsp; This functionality fills a gap that exists in Perl and many other executable programming languages.&nbsp; The separation of data from executable code has many benefits, including allowing executable code to generate results in any sequence instead of the sequence in which they appear in the final result (such as the sequence of items in an HTML file), isolating layout-specific code that non-programmers can edit, switching between different written languages (such as English and French) just by changing a Dashrep phrase's value (such as from "en" to "fr"), switching between different "skins" or appearances using a single Dashrep phrase value, making it easy to switch between singular and plural forms of a word (such as "person" and "people") based on a data-specific count, and supporting complex layouts that go way beyond what templates can handle.</li>

<li>Keep it simple, and keep it flexible.&nbsp; Only a few characters &mdash; space, hyphen/dash, and in some situations square brackets (if they are adjacent to dashes) &mdash; have special significance.&nbsp; These special characters do not overlap with special characters in coding languages such as HTML, XML, JavaScript, etc., so the Dashrep language can more easily generate code in most target languages.</li>

<li>Make the language speakable.&nbsp; This provides a step toward bridging the gap between spoken language (e.g. English) which is highly ambiguous (i.e. words, phrases, and sentences can have multiple meanings), and coding languages that are unambiguous.&nbsp; Soon, mobile technology will increase the use of microphones instead of keyboards, and a spoken language such as Dashrep&mdash;in conjunction with a few special words&mdash;can facilitate creating unambiguous content (such as XML-like information, formatted documents, etc.) that computer software can easily interpret.&nbsp; For people with keyboard-related repetitive-stress injury (RSI), a spoken language provides an alternative to typing symbol-intensive code.</li>

</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<a name="rules"></a>
<h2>Dashrep rules</h2>

<h3>Special characters</h3>

<ul>
<li>The hyphen or dash (<b><i>-</i></b>) character, the space &ldquo;character&rdquo;, and the newline &ldquo;character&rdquo; always have special meaning within Dashrep code.</li>

<li>The open square bracket (<b><i>[</i></b>), close square bracket (<b><i>]</i></b>), slash (<b><i>/</i></b>), and asterisk (<b><i>*</i></b>) can have special meaning within Dashrep code, but only if they are adjacent to a hyphen/dash.</li>

<li>A colon (<b><i>:</i></b>) and equal sign (<b><i>=</i></b>) may have special meaning within Dashrep code, depending upon the context.</li>

<li>All other characters are not special within Dashrep code.</li>

<li>The Dashrep language does <i>not</i> have any special meaning for angle brackets, braces, slashes, and other symbols that are commonly used in other coding languages.</li>

<li>The minimal special-character overlap between the Dashrep language and other languages (including written English) makes it easier to use the Dashrep language to translate content into many target languages.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Hyphenated phrases</h3>

<ul>

<li>Each hyphenated phrase is a shortcut for another text string.&nbsp; Within Dashrep code, wherever the hyphenated phrase appears, the hyphenated phrase is replaced with the text that is defined as being associated with that phrase.&nbsp; The replacement text (its definition) can contain anything, including more hyphenated phrases.&nbsp; This approach allows a small amount of code to expand into a large and/or complex text string.&nbsp; The resulting text string can be an HTML web page, an XML-formatted document, a JavaScript program, or any text file in nearly any target language.</li>

<li>If a hyphenated phrase is encountered but has not been defined, no replacement is done, and the hyphenated phrase remains as-is.</li>

<li>A hyphenated phrase must contain at least one hyphen (<b><i>-</i></b>).&nbsp; A hyphen is the same character as a dash.</li>

<li>A hyphenated phrase cannot begin or end with a hyphen.</li>

<li>A hyphenated phrase cannot begin with a digit (0 to 9).</li>

<li>A hyphenated phrase cannot end with a colon (<b><i>:</i></b>).</li>

<li>Spaces and line breaks serve as delimiters for hyphenated phrases.&nbsp; This means that a hyphenated phrase must begin after a space or at the beginning of a line, and the hyphenated phrase must be followed by a space or the end of the line.&nbsp; Elsewhere a hyphenated phrase is not recognized, and therefore not translated.&nbsp; Of course a hyphenated phrase cannot contain a space, and cannot span a line break.</li>

<li>Square brackets (<b><i>[</i></b> and <b><i>]</i></b>) within a hyphenated phrase have a special interpretation that is explained below.</li>

<li>A hyphenated phrase can contain any characters, including unicode characters, that commonly represent spoken sounds.&nbsp; Symbols that have obscure names without also commonly being used to represent spoken sounds (such as punctuation symbols, or Greek letters in English) should be avoided.&nbsp; Besides having unknown or inconsistent pronunciations, symbols may be significant in the target language.&nbsp; This constraint is not enforced as a limit because a symbol can have different functions in different languages.</li>

<li>The preferred convention is to use only lowercase letters (a to z) and avoid uppercase characters (A to Z).&nbsp; Uppercase characters are allowed anywhere within a hyphenated phrase, but the recognition of phrases is case-sensitive, so using only lowercase letters ensures consistency.&nbsp; If using uppercase characters is desired, preprocessing can check for consistency, or convert all uppercase letters to lowercase letters.&nbsp; (This approach preserves execution speeds without enforcing a convention that some writers will want to avoid.)</li>

<li>Recommendation:&nbsp; Within a hyphenated phrase, adjectives should appear after&mdash;not before&mdash;nouns, as in <b><i>rectangle-large-begin</i></b> (rather than <b><i>begin-large-rectangle</i></b>).&nbsp; This convention quickly identifies the most specific part of a phrase at the beginning of the phrase.&nbsp; Although this convention is unfamiliar to English-only speakers, major languages&mdash;including French, Italian, and Spanish&mdash;follow this convention.</li>

</ul>


<h3>Two contexts: definitions, and text to be translated</h3>

<p>There are two different kinds of Dashrep code.&nbsp; Dashrep code can be the code that contains hyphenated phrases that are replaced by the definitions for those phrases, and this is the translation context.&nbsp; Or, Dashrep code can define Dashrep phrases by associating each phrase with its definition, and this is the definition context.</p>

<p>Within the translation context, the <b><i>dashrep-definitions-begin</i></b> and <b><i>dashrep-definitions-end</i></b> directives switch the context into, and then back out of, the definition context.&nbsp; If the context begins in the definition context, there are no directives that switch the context into the translation context.</p>

<p>The starting context depends on how the Dashrep engine is accessed.&nbsp; If accessed from executable code, there are multiple Dashrep &ldquo;functions&rdquo; that can be executed, and each function determines how the supplied text is handled.&nbsp; If the Dashrep engine is accessed by supplying it with a text file to translate, the initial context is the translation context, and then the <b><i>dashrep-definitions-begin</i></b> and <b><i>dashrep-definitions-end</i></b> directives can be used to change the context.</p>


<h3>Defining a hyphenated phrase</h3>

<ul>

<li>Within the definition context, a hyphenated phrase is defined by following it with the text string that will be replaced wherever the hyphenated name appears.&nbsp; The end of the defined text string must be indicated by three or more successive hyphens (e.g. <b><i>-----</i></b>), or the end of a file, or the phrase <b><i>define-end</i></b>.</li>

<li>After the end of a definition, the next non-commented hyphenated phrase is assumed to be the next hyphenated phrase to be defined.</li>

<li>Within Dashrep code that contains definitions, an optional colon (:) can appear at the end of the hyphenated phrase being defined.&nbsp; The colon is not required, and simply serves to make it visually easier to distinguish a hyphenated phrase from its definition, and easier to find when searching for the definition.</li>

<li>Within executable code, a hyphenated phrase is defined by using the appropriate function or subroutine.&nbsp; The appropriate convention is host-language-specific.</li>

<li>A hyphenated phrase can be redefined at any time within executable program code.&nbsp; When this is done, the hyphenated phrase loses its previous definition.</li>

</ul>


<h3>Replacing hyphenated phrases</h3>

<ul>

<li>During translation, whenever a hyphenated phrase is encountered, the hyphenated phrase is replaced by that phrase's definition.</li>

<li>If an encountered hyphenated phrase is not defined, the hyphenated phrase is retained as-is.</li>

<li>When a hyphen is needed within words, the hyphenated phrase <b><i>hyphen-here</i></b> (see below) can be used.</li>

<li>Text that does not look like a hyphenated phrase is retained as-is.</li>

<li>If a hyphenated phrase contains a hyphenated phrase that, after successive replacements, leads back to the same hyphenated phrase, an endless loop could occur.&nbsp; To prevent this, the Dashrep engine stops if the number of replacements reaches a specified limit (which can be changed).&nbsp; If the number of replacements reaches this limit, an error message states which phrase was replaced the most number of times, and usually this is the phrase that either directly or indirectly contains itself.</li>

</ul>



<h3>Comments</h3>

<ul>

<li>In either the translation or definition context, a comment must begin after a space or at the beginning of a line, and it must start with a slash (/) or an asterisk (*) immediately followed by at least three hyphens (dashes) (e.g. <b><i>/---</i></b> or <b><i>*---</i></b>).</li>

<li>A comment ends with at least three hyphens (dashes) immediately followed by a slash (/) or an asterisk (*) (e.g. <b><i>---/</i></b> or <b><i>---*</i></b>) and then either a space or the end of the line.</li>

<li>The comment can contain anything except the string that identifies the end of the comment.&nbsp; Nesting of comments is not allowed.</li>

<li>Comments are not allowed within a phrase's definition.</li>

</ul>


<h3>Special hyphenated phrases</h3>

<ul>
<li><b><i>hyphen-here</i></b> specifies a hyphen, without adjacent spaces, in the target language.&nbsp; Internally it is defined as <b><i>no-space - no-space</i></b>.</li>

<li><b><i>tab-here</i></b> specifies a tab, without adjacent spaces, in the target code.</li>

<li><b><i>no-space</i></b> specifies the removal of any spaces (concatenation) after all other hyphenated phrases have been replaced.</li>

<li><b><i>one-space</i></b> specifies a single space.</li>

<li><b><i>non-breaking-space</i></b> specifies a single space that is not removed if the <b><i>no-space</i></b> directive is adjacent.</li>

<li><b><i>span-non-breaking-spaces-begin</i></b> and <b><i>span-non-breaking-spaces-end</i></b> requests that non-breaking spaces in the target language, as specified by the definition of the phrase <b><i>non-breaking-space</i></b>, be inserted where spaces appear, and then remove all remaining spaces from the text between these directives (after expanding any parameters in the text).</li>

<li><b><i>new-line</i></b> specifies a line break in the target code.</li>

<li><b><i>empty-line</i></b> specifies an empty line in the target code.</li>

<li><b><i>line-break</i></b> should be used to define a text string that, in turn, specifies a line break in the target language.&nbsp; For example, if the target language is XHTML, normally this phrase should be defined as <b><i>no-space &lt;br /&gt; no-space</i></b>.</li>

<li><b><i>dashrep-definitions-begin</i></b> and <b><i>dashrep-definitions-end</i></b> specify that the text between these phrases are definitions (replacements associated with hyphenated phrases).&nbsp; These phrases cannot be nested.</li>

<li><b><i>define-end</i></b> is the same as several hyphens ("----"), and is provided as a speakable alternative for ending a definition.&nbsp; For symmetry, <b><i>define-begin</i></b> also can be used, but it is ignored (because the context already determines where a definition begins).</li>

<li><b><i>ignore-begin-here</i></b> and <b><i>ignore-end-here</i></b> specify the removal of all text between these phrases.&nbsp; These phrases can be nested.&nbsp; These phrases cannot overlap the <b><i>capture-begin-here</i></b> and <b><i>capture-begin-here</i></b> phrases.</li>

<li><b><i>capture-begin-here</i></b> and <b><i>capture-end-here</i></b> requests that the text between these phrases be captured and put into the definition of the phrase named <b><i>captured-text</i></b>.&nbsp; These phrases can be nested, but the captured text becomes unpredictable.&nbsp; These phrases cannot overlap the <b><i>ignore-begin-here</i></b> and <b><i>ignore-begin-here</i></b> phrases.</li>

<li><b><i>empty-text</i></b> contains no text.&nbsp; It is useful for clearing a phrase by copying.&nbsp; (To test whether a phrase's definition is empty, use the <b><i>empty-or-nonempty-phrase</i></b> action instead.)</li>

</ul>


<h3>Parameter expansion</h3>

<ul>
<li>If a hyphenated phrase appears within square brackets and adjacent inner hyphens (i.e. <b><i>[-</i></b> and <b><i>-]</i></b>) the hyphenated phrase is replaced by its definition before doing replacements of any surrounding text.&nbsp; Such an enclosed hyphenated phrase is called a parameter phrase.</li>

<li>Bracketed parameter phrases can be nested, in which case the replacement process starts with the contents of the innermost brackets.</li>

<li>When parameter phrases appear in sequence (that is, they are not nested), the replacement process starts with the first parameter phrase encountered (which is the left-most).</li>

<li>Some ways of accessing the Dashrep engine do replacements of phrases within the parameter (bracket) notation, but do not also replace phrases that are not within parameter brackets.&nbsp; Other ways of accessing the Dashrep engine do replacements of all phrases, both the ones within the parameter brackets and phrases outside of all parameter brackets, although phrases within parameter brackets are done first.&nbsp; If only parameterized phrases are replaced, the remaining phrases are replaced later, as a separately requested step.</li>

<li>If a parameter phrase expands to text that contains a non-parameter hyphenated phrase, and that non-parameter phrase is later, in a separate step, replaced by text that contains yet another parameter phrase, that isolated parameter phrase will not be expanded in the same step as the original parameter phrase.&nbsp; When parameter phrases are nested to several levels (that is, each definition contains parameter phrases that are expanded in the same step), and parameter brackets are missing at one level of the nesting, this rule can produce results that are unexpected.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Assignment within parameter brackets</h3>

<p>A hyphenated phrase can be defined (or redefined) using the following parameter-notation syntax:  A square open bracket and hyphen (<i>[-</i>), followed by the hyphenated phrase being defined, followed by optional spaces, followed by an equal sign (<i>=</i>), followed by optional spaces, followed by the associated text (which cannot contain parameters), followed by a hyphen and square close bracket (<i>-]</i>).</p>

<p>This kind of assignment, combined with the appropriate use of parameter brackets, allows the same phrase to expand to different text, with each expansion using a different value for the phrase that is assigned this way.&nbsp; Compared to traditional programming languages, the result is analogous to passing different parameter values to a function and getting different results (from the same function).</p>


<h3>Special actions</h3>

<li>At the beginning of a parameter bracket notation, the following special actions, which may be followed by an optional colon (:), are allowed:</li>

<ul>
<li><b><i>empty-or-nonempty</i></b> returns <b><i>empty</i></b> or <b><i>nonempty</i></b> depending upon whether the text that follows (after parameterized replacements have been done) has no characters of text (empty) or contains at least one non-whitespace character (nonempty).</li>

<li><b><i>empty-or-nonempty-phrase</i></b> returns <b><i>empty</i></b> or <b><i>nonempty</i></b> depending upon whether the hyphenated phrase that follows (after parameterized replacements have been done) has a definition that contains no characters of text (empty) or contains at least one non-whitespace character (nonempty).</li>

<li><b><i>same-or-not-same</i></b> returns <b><i>same</i></b> or <b><i>not-same</i></b> depending upon whether the two following parameterized phrases separated by <b><i>-]-[-</i></b> are, after expansion, the same text string or different text strings.</li>

<li><b><i>zero-one-multiple</i></b> returns <b><i>zero</i></b> or <b><i>one</i></b> or <b><i>multiple</i></b> depending upon whether the following number equals zero, one, or multiple (more than one).&nbsp; The number must be in integer text format.</li>

<li><b><i>length-of-text-in-phrase</i></b>, which is followed by a phrase name, returns an integer number that counts the number of characters in the definition of the named phrase.&nbsp; (It is useful for adding leading zeros to integer numbers, and handling monospace fonts.)</li>

<li><b><i>create-list-named</i></b> generates a list using the conventions explained in the section below.</li>

<li><b><i>count-of-list</i></b> returns the number of items in the following list.</li>

<li><b><i>first-item-in-list</i></b> returns the first item in the following list.</li>

<li><b><i>last-item-in-list</i></b> returns the last item in the following list.</li>

<li><b><i>sort-numbers</i></b> returns a numerically sorted list based on the following list.</li>

<li><b><i>unique-value</i></b> generates a unique numeric value and assigns it as the definition of the following hyphenated phrase.&nbsp; Currently this value is a number that is incremented each time this special action is encountered, but future versions may use non-sequential numbers.</li>

<li><b><i>auto-increment</i></b> (which should be used only when really needed) increments the integer value that is named by the following hyphenated phrase.&nbsp; This number is incremented each time this special action is encountered.</li>

<li><b><i>copy-from-phrase-to-phrase</i></b>, which is followed by two phrase names (not one), copies the definition of the first hyphenated phrase into the definition of the second hyphenated phrase.&nbsp; The previous definition of the second hyphenated phrase is deleted.</li>

<li><b><i>copy-from-phrase-to-phrase-with-special-replacements</i></b>, which is followed by two phrase names (not one), copies the definition of the first hyphenated phrase into the definition of the second hyphenated phrase, but special replacements are done to eliminate hyphens, adjacent spaces, and line breaks.&nbsp; The replacement for hyphens is specified in the <b><i>special-replacement-hyphen</i></b> phrase, the replacement for non-first spaces in adjacent spaces is specified in the <b><i>special-replacement-space</i></b> phrase, and the replacement for line breaks is specified in the <b><i>special-replacement-linebreak</i></b> phrase.&nbsp; If any of the special replacement phrases are empty (which is their default value) or contain a hyphen or adjacent spaces or a line break, that type of special replacement is not done.</li>

<li><b><i>append-from-phrase-to-phrase</i></b>, which is followed by two phrase names (not one), copies the definition of the first hyphenated phrase onto the end of the definition of the second hyphenated phrase.&nbsp; Among other uses, this action can be used to insert text (such as a raw Dashrep definition) within other text without being translated.</li>

<li><b><i>insert-phrase-with-brackets-after-next-top-line</i></b> is a linewise action that effectively inserts the specified hyphenated phrase after the next line of text being handled linewise, and it puts that phrase within parameter brackets.&nbsp; This action enables the next line of text to be captured and placed into another phrase, and then the captured text can be used as desired.</li>

</ul>


<h3>Generated lists and list items</h3>

<ul>
<li>Each list must have a name, which must be a hyphenated phrase.</li>

<li>The parameter action <b><i>create-list-named</i></b> (mentioned above) must be used, and it must be followed by the list's name (e.g. <b><i>[-create-list-named: participant-names-full-]</i></b>).</li>

<li>The template for each item in the list must be the definition for a hyphenated phrase whose name begins with <b><i>template-for-list-named-</i></b> and ends with the list's name.&nbsp; Within the template there must be a parameter phrase (in brackets) where the changing portion of the contents will be inserted.&nbsp; Within this template the phrase <b><i>item-number-in-list-being-generated</i></b> can be used to specify the item number, which equals one (1) for the first item.</li>

<li>The name of the parameter phrase that specifies the changing contents must be specified by a hyphenated phrase that begins with <b><i>parameter-name-for-list-named-</i></b> and end with the list's name.&nbsp; (See <a href="http://www.Dashrep.org/learn.html#exampleoflist">example</a>.)</li>

<li>The list of values to be substituted into the specified parameter phrase (within the template) must be identified as the hyphenated phrase that begins with <b><i>list-of-parameter-values-for-list-named-</i></b> and ends with the list's name.&nbsp; The list of values must be text items (which can be numbers) that are separated by spaces and/or commas.&nbsp; (See <a href="http://www.Dashrep.org/learn.html#exampleoflist">example</a>.)&nbsp; Spaces cannot appear within any list items, although the list item can be a hyphenated phrase that is replaced later, in a separate translation step.</li>

<li>Optionally, a prefix and suffix for each list item can be specified using hyphenated phrases that begin with <b><i>prefix-for-list-named-</i></b> and <b><i>suffix-for-list-named-</i></b>, respectively.</li>

<li>The entire list becomes available as a hyphenated phrase that begins with <b><i>generated-list-named-</i></b> and ends with the list's name.</li>

<li>Each item in the list becomes available as a hyphenated phrase that is a concatenation of <b><i>item-for-list-</i></b> followed by the name of the list and followed by <b><i>-and-parameter-</i></b> and followed by the parameter value for the specified item (in the list).</li>

<li>A phrase with the prefix <b><i>logged-list-of-parameter-values-for-list-named-</i></b> lists the parameter values that are used to create the list.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Top-level (file-related) actions</h3>

<p>For script-like control at the top level (not for nested use), the following actions are available:</p>

<ul>
<li><b><i>append-from-phrase-to-phrase</i></b> copies the definition of the first specified hyphenated phrase onto the end of the definition of the second specified hyphenated phrase.&nbsp; (This action is equivalent to the same action that is available at all levels.)</li>

<li><b><i>copy-from-phrase-append-to-file</i></b> copies the definition of the hyphenated phrase onto the end of the specified file.&nbsp; The file must be in the local folder/directory, and if a path specification appears at the beginning of the file name that path is ignored.</li>

<li><b><i>expand-phrase-to-file</i></b> does a Dashrep translation of the specified phrase (which is the first item after this action name) and then writes the results to the named file (which is the second item after this action).&nbsp; The created file is placed in the local folder/directory, even if a path specification appears at the beginning of the file name.</li>

<li><b><i>copy-from-file-to-phrase</i></b> copies the text in the specified file to the definition of the specified hyphenated phrase (without preserving the previous definition).&nbsp; The source file must be in the local folder/directory, and if a path specification appears at the beginning of the file name it is ignored.</li>

<li><b><i>create-empty-file</i></b> creates an empty file using the specified file name, and erases the file if it already exists.&nbsp; The created file is placed in the local folder/directory, even if a path specification appears at the beginning of the file name.</li>

<li><b><i>delete-file</i></b> deletes the specified file.</li>

<li><b><i>write-all-dashrep-definitions-to-file</i></b> writes all the Dashrep definitions to a new file with the specified file name, and erases the file if it already exists.&nbsp; The created file is placed in the local folder/directory, even if a path specification appears at the beginning of the file name.&nbsp; Normally the definitions are written in Dashrep-readable format, but the <b><i>dashrep-yes-or-no-export-delimited-definitions</i></b> phrase, which is explained below, can choose a different delimited format.</li>

<li><b><i>write-all-dashrep-phrase-names-to-file</i></b> writes all the Dashrep phrase names to a new file with the specified file name, and erases the file if it already exists.&nbsp; The created file is placed in the local folder/directory, even if a path specification appears at the beginning of the file name.</li>

<li><b><i>write-dashrep-definitions-listed-in-phrase-to-file</i></b> writes (in Dashrep-readable form) the definitions of the phrases that are named in the definition of the phrase that follows this action name, and writes those definitions to the named file that follows the specified phrase.&nbsp; The created file is placed in the local folder/directory, even if a path specification appears at the beginning of the file name.</li>

<li><b><i>get-definitions-from-file</i></b> reads the Dashrep definitions from the specified file, and overwrites any existing definitions that have the same phrase name.</li>

<li><b><i>clear-all-dashrep-phrases</i></b> clears all the definitions of all Dashrep phrases.</li>

<li><b><i>linewise-translate-from-file-to-file</i></b> translates, one line at a time, the text from the specified input file into the specified result file, using the currently defined Dashrep phrase definitions.&nbsp; Variations of this action, namely <b><i>linewise-translate-parameters-only-from-file-to-file</i></b> and <b><i>linewise-translate-phrases-only-from-file-to-file</i></b> allow just parameters or just phrases (without parameters) to be translated.</li>

<li><b><i>linewise-translate-xml-tags-in-file-to-dashrep-phrases-in-file</i></b> converts XML in the specified input file into Dashrep phrases where each phrase is a concatenation of the XML tag names (e.g. "begin-xml-peoplelist-person-name" and "end-xml-peoplelist-person-name").&nbsp; This convention, along with appropriate definitions for those phrase names, enables an XML or XHTML file to be converted into any kind of text file.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Internal phrase names</h3>

<p>The following phrases provide internal control of Dashrep translations for handling special situations.</p>

<ul>
<li><b><i>dashrep-endless-loop-counter-limit</i></b> can be redefined to a different numeric value.&nbsp; The number may need to be increased if a very large number of replacements is normal for the amount of data being processed.</li>

<li><b><i>dashrep-comments-ignored</i></b> contains all the text that were identified as comments.&nbsp; This content can be viewed to verify that non-comments are not mistakenly marked as comments.</li>

<li><b><i>dashrep-ignore-level</i></b> is the numeric count of nested <i>ignore-begin-here</i> and <i>ignore-end-here</i> actions.&nbsp; This number can be saved and restored if one translation task needs to be interrupted and another started or re-started.</li>

<li><b><i>dashrep-capture-level</i></b> is the numeric count of nested <i>capture-begin-here</i> and <i>capture-end-here</i> actions.&nbsp; This number can be saved and restored if one translation task needs to be interrupted and another started or re-started.</li>

<li><b><i>dashrep-first-xml-tag-name</i></b> supplies an XML tag name (without angle brackets) to the <i>linewise-translate-xml-tags-in-file-to-dashrep-phrases-in-file</i> action to indicate the first XML tag to be recognized.&nbsp; Tags at higher levels within the XML structure are ignored.</li>

<li><b><i>dashrep-list-of-xml-phrases</i></b> contains a list of all the phrase names that were written by the <i>linewise-translate-xml-tags-in-file-to-dashrep-phrases-in-file</i> action.</li>

<li><b><i>dashrep-xml-yes-handle-open-close-tag-</i></b> is a prefix that can be followed by the name of an XML tag to indicate that the specified tag is to be regarded as both an opening and closing tag.&nbsp; For example, if the phrase <i>dashrep-xml-yes-handle-open-close-tag-img</i> is defined as <i>yes</i>, the <i>img</i> (image) tag within HTML code does not need to be terminated with <i>"/>"</i> in order to be terminated.</li>

<li><b><i>dashrep-xml-yes-ignore-tag-named-</i></b> is a prefix that can be followed by the name of an XML tag that is to be ignored.&nbsp; For example, if the phrase <i>dashrep-xml-yes-ignore-tag-named-div</i> is defined as <i>yes</i>, the <i>div</i> tags within HTML code will be ignored.</li>

<li><b><i>dashrep-xml-replacement-name-for-tag-named-</i></b> is a prefix that can be followed by the name of an XML tag that should be replaced by this phrase's definition.&nbsp; For example, if the phrase <i>dashrep-xml-replacement-name-for-tag-named-th</i> is defined as <i>td</i>, then any <i>th</i> tag is replaced by the <i>td</i> tag in the generated Dashrep phrases.</li>

<li><b><i>dashrep-yes-or-no-export-delimited-definitions</i></b> can be set to <i>yes</i> so that the <i>write-all-dashrep-definitions-to-file</i> action exports definitions that are delimited by the following phrases at appropriate positions: <b><i>export-defs-all-begin</i></b>, <b><i>export-defs-all-end</i></b>, <b><i>export-defs-phrase-begin</i></b>, <b><i>export-defs-phrase-end</i></b>, <b><i>export-defs-def-begin</i></b>, and <b><i>export-defs-def-end</i></b>.&nbsp; This approach allows these phrases to be defined so that a separate Dashrep translation can generate code such as HTML, XML, or SQL.&nbsp; If the value of this phrase is anything other than <i>yes</i>, then the exported definitions use the usual Dashrep convention in which the phrase being defined appears first, then is followed by the definition, and multiple dashes terminate the definition.</li>

<li><b><i>dashrep-xml-trace-on-or-off</i></b> can be defined as <i>on</i> to turn on a debugging trace mode that writes detailed information about converting XML code into Dashrep code.&nbsp; Any value other than <i>on</i> leaves this debugging trace mode turned off.</li>

<li><b><i>dashrep-linewise-trace-on-or-off</i></b> can be defined as <i>on</i> to turn on a debugging trace mode that writes detailed information about the handling of linewise translations.&nbsp; Any value other than <i>on</i> leaves this debugging trace mode turned off.</li>

<li><b><i>dashrep-ignore-trace-on-or-off</i></b> can be defined as <i>on</i> to turn on a debugging trace mode that writes detailed information about what text is ignored by the <i>ignore-begin-here</i> and <i>ignore-end-here</i> actions.&nbsp; Any value other than <i>on</i> leaves this debugging trace mode turned off.</li>

<li><b><i>dashrep-capture-trace-on-or-off</i></b> can be defined as <i>on</i> to turn on a debugging trace mode that writes detailed information about what text is captured by the <i>capture-begin-here</i> and <i>capture-end-here</i> actions.&nbsp; Any value other than <i>on</i> leaves this debugging trace mode turned off.</li>

</ul>


<h3>Special phrases reserved for future use</h3>

<ul>
<li>Any hyphenated phrase that begins with <b><i>dashrep-</i></b> is reserved.</li>

<li>The hyphenated phrases <b><i>comment-begin</i></b> and <b><i>comment-end</i></b> are reserved as comment delimiters.&nbsp; This would enable these delimiters to be spoken.</li>

<li>The hyphenated phrases <b><i>yes-if-not-no</i></b>, <b><i>no-if-not-yes</i></b>, <b><i>yes-if-all-yes</i></b>, and <b><i>no-if-all-no</i></b> are reserved to allow better true/false logic.</li>

<li>The hyphenated phrase <b><i>calculate-if-empty</i></b> is reserved to implement an action that checks whether the following phrase is empty, and then if it is empty, replaces the parameter (containing both this action name and the empty phrase name) with a parameterized (bracketed) phrase that begins with <b><i>how-to-calculate-</i></b> and ends with the name of the empty phrase.&nbsp; This action, which would precede the use of the phrase's value, makes it easy to let the software determine whether the phrase's value has already been calculated, and provides a way to calculate the value if it is still empty.&nbsp; If a calculated value might be empty (as a valid value), the phrase should be calculated as part of a related calculation, such as "initialization-done" with a "yes" or "no" result.</li>

<li>The actions <b><i>escape-with-definition-if-not-empty</i></b> and <b><i>resume-after-escape</i></b> are planned as a way to interrupt translation, execute some action that cannot be done using the Dashrep engine, and then resume the Dashrep translation process.&nbsp; Specifically, if the specified phrase is empty, the translation process stops, the partially translated text is stored in the <i>dashrep-translation-before-escape</i> phrase, then just the (non-empty) value of the specified phrase is inserted as the replacement for the entire text being expanded, and then when the Dashrep code executes again, translation resumes where it left off if the <i>resume-after-escape</i> action is the first phrase encountered.&nbsp; (If the <i>resume-after-escape</i> phrase is not the first phrase encountered, the partially translated text is discarded; if the <i>resume-after-escape</i> phrase is encountered at any other time, the action is not recognized, and remains untranslated.)&nbsp; This capability will allow the Dashrep engine to implement powerful functionality, such as implementing an interactive website that dynamically generates diverse, complex web pages, with the dependencies specified in Dashrep code (as data) instead of being written in executable code (which can be very time-consuming to debug).&nbsp; Also this functionality can be used to implement the equivalent of executing a &ldquo;make&rdquo; file, in which case the supplied non-empty text can be the text of an executable command, and the dependencies can be specified in Dashrep phrases.</li>

<li>The actions <b><i>pop-last-item-from-list</i></b> and <b><i>remove-last-item-from-list</i></b> are reserved to handle list items.</li>

<li>The hyphenated phrases <b><i>calc-sum</i></b>, <b><i>calc-multiply</i></b>, <b><i>calc-minus</i></b>, <b><i>calc-divide-by</i></b>, <b><i>calc-truncate-to-integer</i></b>, <b><i>calc-convert-to-dollars-and-cents</i></b> (by rounding if necessary), <b><i>greater-than-yes-or-no</i></b>, and <b><i>less-than-yes-or-no</i></b> are reserved to implement basic calculation capabilities.&nbsp; (The values will be stored as text, not as binary values.)</li>

<li>The hyphenated phrases <b><i>get-time</i></b>, <b><i>get-modification-time-for-file</i></b>, <b><i>time-year-number</i></b>, <b><i>time-month-number</i></b>, <b><i>time-day-number</i></b>,<b><i>time-day-of-week-number</i></b>, <b><i>time-24-hour-number</i></b>, <b><i>time-am-pm</i></b>, <b><i>time-minutes</i></b>, and <b><i>time-seconds</i></b> are reserved to make date and time information available, and in a way that can be combined to produce nearly any format.</li>

<li>Each internet domain name can claim any phrase that begins with the string <b><i>domain-</i></b> followed by the domain name with dots (periods) replaced by hyphens (<i>-</i>) (and followed by a hyphen).  For example, domainname.com can claim any phrase that begins with <i>domain-domainname-com-</i>.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Spoken versions of Dashrep content</h3>

<p>When the Dashrep language is spoken, the following special words should be recognized and handled by the voice-recognition software.&nbsp; They indicate the beginning and ending of hyphenated phrases, parameterized hyphenated phrases, and comments.&nbsp; These words eliminate the need to say the word <b><i>hyphen</i></b> within hyphenated phrases.&nbsp; These names should also be handled when they appear in the text, but the current implementation of the Dashrep language does not yet recognize them.</p>

<ul>

<li><b><i>dashbee</i></b> indicates the beginning of a hyphenated phrase.</li>

<li><b><i>dashenn</i></b> indicates the end of a hyphenated phrase.</li>

<li><b><i>parambee</i></b> indicates the beginning of a parameterized hyphenated phrase (which may be part of a hyphenated phrase).</li>

<li><b><i>paramenn</i></b> indicates the end of a parameterized hyphenated phrase.</li>

<li><b><i>combee</i></b> indicates the beginning of a comment.</li>

<li><b><i>comenn</i></b> indicates the end of a comment.</li>

<li><b><i>fen</i></b> (the last syllable of <b><i>hyphen</i></b>) indicates a hyphen.</li>

</ul>

<h3>Functionality</h3>

<p>Although Dashrep code is not directly executable, it can generate executable code.&nbsp; Although it does not directly define loops, it generates lists in which any space-delimited and/or comma-delimited list of text strings (including integers) can specify the unique values for the list items.&nbsp; Although the Dashrep language does not directly implement a branching structure, the translated code can be completely changed at any level (including within lists) based on parameterized hyphenated phrases such as <b><i>[-template-for-move-proposal-link-for-action-[-output-requested-action-]-]</i></b>.&nbsp; Also, Dashrep code makes it easier to move data out of executable code (where data does not belong).</p>

<a name="history"></a>
<h2>What is the origin of the Dashrep language?</h2>

<p>The Dashrep language was developed by Richard Fobes, author of <i>The Creative Problem Solver's Toolbox</i>, over many years of personal use.&nbsp; A Perl-language, open-source implementation was released on 2009-May-7.</p>

<p>Early versions of the Dashrep language were used to write two books, <i>The Creative Problem Solver's Toolbox</i> and <i>Ending The Hidden Unfairness In U.S. Elections</i>.&nbsp; At <a href="www.VoteFair.org">www.VoteFair.org</a> and <a href="www.NegotiationTool.com">www.NegotiationTool.com</a> Dashrep code is interpreted to dynamically generate each interactive HTML (web) page (with Perl code providing all the executable functionality).&nbsp; The language was used to generate JavaScript code that Adobe Illustrator executed to generate vector graphics for use in the book titled <i>Ending The Hidden Unfairness In U.S. Elections</i>.&nbsp; And an early version of the Dashrep language is still used to generate invoices and packing slips for the publishing business named Solutions Through Innovation.</p>

<p>Obviously the letters &ldquo;dash&rdquo; in the name Dashrep refer to the use of dashes (which are the same as hyphens).&nbsp; Less obviously, the letters &ldquo;rep&rdquo; in the name Dashrep refer to the first letters in the word &ldquo;replace&rdquo; and &ldquo;replacement&rdquo;.</p>
