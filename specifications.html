<h1> Fundamental characters &amp; strings </h1> <table>
<tr><th>Normal <br \> priority</th><th>Name</th><th>Appearance</th><th>Description</th></tr>
<tr><td>1</td><td>Comment</td><td><b><i>*---&nbsp;</i></b> comment here &nbsp; <b><i>---*</i></b></td><td>Comments are ignored.&nbsp; The <b><i>*---</i></b> string indicates the beginning of a comment, and the <b><i>---*</i></b> string indicates the end of the comment.&nbsp; Comments cannot be nested; if they are, the results are unpredictable.</td></tr>

<tr><td>2</td><td>Comment</td><td><b><i>comment-begin</i></b> comment here <b><i>comment-end</i></b></td><td>An alternate way &mdash; that is speakable &mdash; to insert a comment.&nbsp; The <b><i>comment-begin</i></b> phrase indicates the beginning of a comment, and the <b><i>comment-end</i></b> phrase indicates the end of the comment.&nbsp; Comments cannot be nested.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Space</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td>Each space is significant as a delimiter for hyphenated phrases and words (without hyphens).</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Three or more adjacent hyphens</td><td><b><i>----</i></b></td><td>Indicates the end of a definition, in a situation where a hyphenated phrase is defined using the <b><i>begin-...</i></b> directive (or the equivalent).</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Parameter</td><td><b><i>[-</i></b> &nbsp; parameter &nbsp; <b><i>-]</i></b></td><td>A parameter is expanded before the surrounding text is expanded.&nbsp; The first-encountered innermost parameter is expanded first.&nbsp; Spaces at the beginning and end of the parameter are removed, which allows the expanded text to become part of a hyphenated phrase, which in turn enables branching and indexing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Assignment</td><td><b><i>[-</i></b> text-container <b><i>=</i></b> new text <b><i>-]</i></b></td><td>If a parameter contains an equal sign (=) and there is one hyphenated phrase between the equal sign and the beginning of the parameter, the text to the right of the equal sign (up to the end of the parameter) is assigned as the definition of the phrase.&nbsp; If the hyphenated phrase already had a definition, that definition is discarded.&nbsp; If the text between the beginning of a parameter and an equal sign is not one hyphenated phrase, the equal sign is not recognized as being part of an assignment.&nbsp; The assignment capability enables the same phrase to produce different results, which is what a "function" does in traditional programming languages.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Phrase name in parameter brackets</td><td><b><i>[-</i></b> user-phrase-name <b><i>-]</i></b></td><td>A hyphenated phrase within parameter brackets is expanded according to the phrase's definition (which itself can contain parameters).&nbsp; If the phrase name is not defined, it is left as-is, and the parameter brackets are removed.&nbsp; Spaces at the beginning and end of the parameter are removed, which allows the expanded text to become part of a hyphenated phrase, which in turn enables branching and indexing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Action</td><td><b><i>[-</i></b> zero-one-multiple 3 <b><i>-]</i></b></td><td>If the first (left-most) hyphenated phrase inside a parameter is one of the recognized actions (listed below), and the action is followed by text that the action knows how to handle, the action is performed.&nbsp; Some actions produce text that becomes the replacement for the parameter, whereas other actions operate on phrases or files and do not produce any text.</td></tr>

<h1>Fundamental phrases</h1>


<h2>hyphen-here</h2>
<p>Inserts a hyphen, with no adjacent spaces.&nbsp; Internally this phrase is defined as <b><i>no-space - no-space</i></b>.</p>


<h2>tab-here</h2>
<p>Specifies a tab and the removal of adjacent spaces.</p>


<h2>no-space</h2>
<p>Specifies the removal of any spaces (concatenation) after all other phrases have been replaced.&nbsp; If the <b><i>one-space</i></b> directive is adjacent, the <b><i>no-space</i></b> directive is ignored.</p>


<h2>one-space</h2>
<p>Specifies a single space.&nbsp; If the <b><i>no-space</i></b> directive is adjacent, the <b><i>no-space</i></b> directive is ignored.</p>


<h2>character-single-space</h2>
<p>A pre-defined phrase that contains just a single space.</p>


<h2>non-breaking-space</h2>
<p>Specifies a single space that is not removed if the <b><i></i></b> directive is adjacent.</p>


<h2>span-non-breaking-spaces-begin</h2>
<p>When used in conjunction with the phrase <b><i>span-non-breaking-spaces-end</i></b>, requests that non-breaking spaces in the target language, as specified by the definition of the phrase <b><i>non-breaking-space</i></b>, be inserted where spaces appear, and then all the remaining spaces are removed (after expanding any parameters in the text).</p>


<h2>span-non-breaking-spaces-end</h2>
<p>See the description for the phrase <b><i>span-non-breaking-spaces-end</i></b>.</p>


<h2>new-line</h2>
<p>Specifies a line break.</p>


<h2>empty-line</h2>
<p>Specifies an empty line.</p>


<h2>line-break</h2>
<p>Should be used to define a text string that, in turn, specifies a line break in the target language.&nbsp; For example, if the target language is XHTML, normally this phrase should be defined as <b><i>&lt;br /&gt;</i></b> .</p>


<h2>dashrep-definitions-begin</h2>
<p>Specifies that the text that follows are phrases and definitions.&nbsp; These phrases cannot be nested.&nbsp; This change continues until the phrase <b><i>definitions-end</i></b> is encountered.</p>


<h2>dashrep-definitions-end</h2>
<p>Specifies the end of phrases and definitions that began with the <b><i>definitions-begin</i></b> directive.</p>


<h2>define-end</h2>
<p>The same as several hyphens (<b><i>----</i></b>).&nbsp; It is provided as a speakable alternative for ending a definition.</p>


<h2>define-begin</h2>
<p>This phrase is ignored, but is defined for symmetry so that it can be used after the <b><i>define-end</i></b> phrase.&nbsp; It is not needed because the context already determines where a definition begins.</p>


<h2>clear-phrase</h2>
<p>Clears the definition for the specified phrase.&nbsp; This action is equivalent to using the equal-sign notation without any text for the new definition.</p>


<h2>empty-text</h2>
<p>Contains no text.&nbsp; It is useful for clearing a phrase by copying, although the <b><i>clear-phrase</i></b> is a better choice.&nbsp; To test whether a phrase's definition is empty, use the <b><i>empty-or-nonempty-phrase</i></b> action.</p>


<h2>expand-phrase-to-phrase</h2>
<p>Expands ("translates") the contents of the first phrase and puts the results into the second phrase.&nbsp; This action provides a way to translate many different chunks of text rather than translating all text using the same translation choices.&nbsp; It is especially useful if the text contains hyphens but is not Dashrep code.</p>


<h2>calculate-if-phrase-empty</h2>
<p>Checks whether the specified phrase is empty, and then if it is empty, replaces the parameter (containing both this action name and the empty phrase name) with a parameterized (bracketed) phrase that begins with <b><i>how-to-calculate-</i></b> and ends with the name of the empty phrase.&nbsp; This action, which would typically precede the use of the phrase's value, makes it easy to let the software determine whether the phrase's value has already been calculated, and provides a way to calculate the value if it is still empty.&nbsp; If a calculated value might be empty (as a valid value), the phrase should be calculated as part of a related calculation, such as <b><i>initialization-done</i></b> with a <b><i>yes</i></b> or <b><i>no</i></b> result.</p>


<h1>Decision-related phrases</h1>


<h2>empty-or-nonempty-word</h2>
<p>Equals either <b><i>empty</i></b> or <b><i>nonempty</i></b> depending upon whether the specified phrase has no characters of text (empty) or contains at least one non-whitespace character (nonempty).</p>


<h2>empty-or-nonempty-phrase</h2>
<p>Equals either <b><i>empty</i></b> or <b><i>nonempty</i></b> depending upon whether the hyphenated phrase that follows (after parameterized replacements have been done) has a definition that contains no characters of text (empty) or contains at least one non-whitespace character (nonempty).</p>


<h2>same-or-not-same-two-words</h2>
<p>Equals either <b><i>same</i></b> or <b><i>not-same</i></b> depending upon whether the following two words (space-delimited text strings) have the same definition.</p>


<h2>same-or-not-same-two-phrases</h2>
<p>Equals either <b><i>same</i></b> or <b><i>not-same</i></b> depending upon whether the following two phrases have the same definition.</p>


<h2>yes-if-not-no</h2>
<p>Equals <b><i>no</i></b> if the following word (space-delimited text string) is <b><i>no</i></b>, and is <b><i>yes</i></b> otherwise.&nbsp; This action is useful if the word can be something other than <b><i>yes</i></b> or <b><i>no</i></b>, but only <b><i>no</i></b> is significant.</p>


<h2>no-if-not-yes</h2>
<p>Equals <b><i>yes</i></b> if the following word (space-delimited text string) is <b><i>yes</i></b>, and is <b><i>no</i></b> otherwise.&nbsp; This action is useful if the word can be something other than <b><i>yes</i></b> or <b><i>no</i></b>, but only <b><i>yes</i></b> is significant.</p>


<h1>Number-related phrases</h1>


<h2>zero-one-multiple</h2>
<p>Equals either <b><i>zero</i></b> or <b><i>one</i></b> or <b><i>multiple</i></b> depending upon whether the following integer number equals zero, one, or multiple (more than one).&nbsp; This phrase is very useful for choosing between singular and plural forms of words based on a data-supplied count.</p>


<h2>yes-or-no-first-number-equals-second-number</h2>
<p>Equals <b><i>yes</i></b> if the following two numbers are equal, and is <b><i>no</i></b> otherwise.&nbsp; This action is useful if the numbers might contain leading zeros, in which case <b><i>040</i></b> is recognized as being equal to <b><i>40</i></b>.</p>


<h2>calc-add</h2>
<p>Adds the numbers that follow.&nbsp; Two or more integer or decimal numbers numbers must be supplied.&nbsp; Put into heading for "calc" actions: Each calculation converts the text-based digits into binary values, and the result is converted back into text-based digits, so the number of calculations should be limited.&nbsp; Alternate wording:&nbsp; The numbers can be positive or negative integers, or they can be positive or negative decimal numbers, but floating-point numbers are not recognized.&nbsp; If there is a negative sign, it must be adjacent to the digits.&nbsp; The numbers are stored as text, not in a binary form, so these calculations are not fast (especially for decimal numbers).&nbsp; If more than a few simple calculations are being done, numerical processing should be done within the host language (such as by using the action [ <b><i>...</i></b> ]).</p>


<h2>calc-minus</h2>
<p>Subtracts the second number from the first number.</p>


<h2>calc-divide-by</h2>
<p>Calculates the result of dividing the first number by the second number.</p>


<h2>calc-multiply</h2>
<p>Multiplies the numbers that follow.&nbsp; Two or more integer or decimal numbers numbers must be supplied.</p>


<h2>calc-maximum</h2>
<p>Determines the maximum number from among a list of numbers.</p>


<h2>calc-minimum</h2>
<p>Determines the minimum number from among a list of numbers.</p>


<h2>calc-integer</h2>
<p>Removes the digits to the right of the decimal point (without rounding and without special handling for negative numbers).</p>


<h2>calc-absolute</h2>
<p>Removes a minus sign if it is at the beginning of an integer or decimal number.</p>


<h2>calc-equal-greater-less-compare</h2>
<p>Equals <b><i>equal</i></b> if the following two numbers are equal, or it equals <b><i>greater</i></b> if the first number is greater than the second number, or it equals <b><i>less</i></b> if the first number is less than the second number.</p>


<h2>auto-increment</h2>
<p>Increments the integer value in the named phrase.&nbsp; This number is incremented each time this special action is encountered.&nbsp; Use of this action should be avoided.&nbsp; Usually the action <b><i>use-template-and-parameters-to-create-simple-list-with-name</i></b> (or the <b><i>full</i></b> list version) and the <b><i>createlist-item-number</i></b> phrase, or the action [ <b><i>...</i></b> ] can be used instead.</p>


<h2>length-of-phrase-definition</h2>
<p>Equals the number of characters that are contained in the definition of the specified phrase.</p>


<h1>Time-related phrases</h1>


<h2>get-current-time-in-epoch-seconds</h2>
<p>Gets the time as an integer number that indicates the number of seconds since January 1, 1970 at midnight GMT (UTC).&nbsp; This convention matches the convention used in Linux and Windows, but not the convention used by Apple.</p>


<h2>split-epoch-seconds-into-named-components</h2>
<p>Uses the supplied epoch seconds to put appropriate numbers into the phrases that begin with the word <b><i>time</i></b>.&nbsp; The results are specific for the time at the location of the server on which the code is running, which may not match the local time of the user.&nbsp; Simple Dashrep definitions (that use these values) can easily generate nearly any date and time format.</p>


<h2>time-day-of-month</h2>
<p>The day of the month (such as 1, 2, ... 31), based on the epoch seconds supplied to the <b><i>split-epoch-seconds-into-named-components</i></b> action.</p>


<h2>time-day-of-week</h2>
<p>The numerical day of the month where 1 indicates Monday, 2 indicates Tuesday, and so on, based on the epoch seconds supplied to the <b><i>split-epoch-seconds-into-named-components</i></b> action.</p>


<h2>time-day-of-year</h2>
<p>The numerical day of the year (1, 2, ... 365, 366), based on the epoch seconds supplied to the <b><i>split-epoch-seconds-into-named-components</i></b> action.</p>


<h2>time-hour</h2>
<p>The hour of the day, based on the epoch seconds supplied to the <b><i>split-epoch-seconds-into-named-components</i></b> action.</p>


<h2>time-minute</h2>
<p>The minute of the hour, based on the epoch seconds supplied to the <b><i>split-epoch-seconds-into-named-components</i></b> action.</p>


<h2>time-month-number</h2>
<p>The numerical month number where 1 indicates January, 2 indicates February, and so on, based on the epoch seconds supplied to the <b><i>split-epoch-seconds-into-named-components</i></b> action.</p>


<h2>time-second</h2>
<p>The seconds of the minute (0, 1, 2, ... 59), based on the epoch seconds supplied to the <b><i>split-epoch-seconds-into-named-components</i></b> action.</p>


<h2>time-year</h2>
<p>The year (such as <b><i>2012</i></b>), based on the epoch seconds supplied to the <b><i>split-epoch-seconds-into-named-components</i></b> action.</p>


<h1>Character-related phrases</h1>


<h2>within-phrase-replace-character-with-text-in-phrase</h2>
<p>Replaces each occurrence of the specified character with the definition in the specified phrase.</p>


<h2>split-phrase-into-list-of-characters</h2>
<p>Splits the content of a phrase into separate characters, with a space between each space.&nbsp; At places where there was one space, the word <b><i>one-space-here</i></b> is inserted.</p>


<h2>count-of-characters-in-phrase-defintion</h2>
<p>Counts the number of characters (including spaces) in the specified phrase definition.</p>


<h2>character-in-phrase-get-at-position</h2>
<p>Gets one character from the specified phrase definition, with the character position being specified by an integer number.&nbsp; Position 1 indicates the first character.</p>


<h1>Word-related phrases</h1>


<h2>first-word-in-phrase</h2>
<p>Gets the first word from a phrase definition.&nbsp; Words are regarded as text strings that do not contain any spaces, and which are separated by one (or more) spaces.</p>


<h2>last-word-in-phrase</h2>
<p>Gets the last word from a phrase definition.&nbsp; Words are regarded as text strings that do not contain any spaces, and which are separated by one (or more) spaces.&nbsp; If the definition contains no spaces, the entire definition is supplied.</p>


<h2>from-phrase-get-word-number</h2>
<p>Gets the specified word from a phrase definition, with the position of that word being specified by an integer number.&nbsp; The number 1 specifies the first word.&nbsp; Words are regarded as text strings that do not contain any spaces, and which are separated by one (or more) spaces.</p>


<h2>count-of-words-in-phrase</h2>
<p>Counts the number of words in a phrase definition.&nbsp; Words are regarded as text strings that do not contain any spaces, and which are separated by one (or more) spaces.&nbsp; If the definition contains only spaces, or is empty, the value <b><i>0</i></b> (zero) is supplied.</p>


<h2>zero-one-multiple-count-of-words-in-phrase</h2>
<p>Equals either <b><i>zero</i></b> or <b><i>one</i></b> or <b><i>multiple</i></b> depending upon whether a phrase definition contains zero words, one word, or multiple (two or more) words.</p>


<h2>position-of-word-in-phrase</h2>
<p>Finds the specified word in a phrase definition and supplies the number that indicates its word position.&nbsp; If the word is not found, the value <b><i>0</i></b> (zero) is supplied.&nbsp; Words are regarded as text strings that do not contain any spaces, and which are separated by one (or more) spaces.</p>


<h2>copy-from-two-phrases-words-found-in-both-to-phrase</h2>
<p>Copies into the definition of the third phrase any words that appear in both of the indicated phrase definitions.&nbsp; For example, if the first phrase definition is <b><i>abc 123 def 456</i></b> and the second definition is <b><i>def 789 xyz 123</i></b> then the third phrase is defined as <b><i>def 123</i></b> (or <b><i>123 def</i></b>).</p>


<h2>copy-from-first-phrase-words-not-found-in-second-phrase-to-phrase</h2>
<p>Copies into the definition of the third phrase any words that appear in the first phrase definition but do not appear in the second phrase definition.&nbsp; For example, if the first phrase definition is <b><i>abc 123 def 456</i></b> and the second definition is <b><i>def 789 xyz 123</i></b> then the third phrase is defined as <b><i>abc 456</i></b> (or <b><i>456 abc</i></b>).</p>


<h2>copy-from-phrase-unique-words-to-phrase</h2>
<p>Copies from the definition of the first phrase all the words that appear in that definition, but without repeating any words that are repeated in the definition.&nbsp; For example, if the first phrase definition is <b><i>abc 123 def 123 abc</i></b> then the second phrase is defined as <b><i>abc 123 def</i></b> (although a specific word order is not guaranteed).</p>


<h1>List-generation phrases</h1>


<h2>use-template-and-parameters-to-create-simple-list-with-name</h2>
<p>Generates a list, where the changing value of each item in the list comes from the definition of the second phrase, and where the definition of the first phrase is a template that indicates the what text appears in the final list.&nbsp; The third phrase indicates the name of the generated list.&nbsp; The template should include the bracketed phrase <b><i>createlist-parameter</i></b> wherever the changing value is needed.&nbsp; The definition of the second phrase must contain a list of words (or possibly no words), and each word in that list is used as one of the changing values.&nbsp; If the template includes a separate list-generation request (such as for a nested list), the <b><i>createlist-parameter</i></b> value will lose its expected value, so it should be copied into another phrase prior to requesting the secondary list.</p>


<h2>use-template-and-parameters-to-create-full-list-with-name</h2>
<p>Generates a list in the same way as the <b><i>use-template-and-parameters-to-create-simple-list-with-name</i></b> action, with one difference and with added capabilities.&nbsp; The difference is that the generated list is a list of phrase names, and those named phrases contain the text of each item.&nbsp; The individual items have phrase names that begin with the specified phrase name, and are followed by the string <b><i>-for-parameter-</i></b> and that is followed by the parameter value.&nbsp; Within the template the phrases [ <b><i>...</i></b> ] have special meanings, which are described separately.&nbsp; The phrases [ <b><i>...</i></b> ] contain prefix, delimiter, and suffix text, and their usage is described with those phrase descriptions.</p>


<h2>counts-from-integer-to-integer-put-into-phrase</h2>
<p>Generates a list of integers and puts them into the definition of the third phrase.&nbsp; The supplied integers indicate the starting and ending values.&nbsp; For example, <b><i>counts-from-integer-to-integer-put-into-phrase 1 10 one-to-ten</i></b> defines the phrase <b><i>one-to-ten</i></b> as <b><i>1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10</i></b>.</p>


<h2>every-combination-of-counts-from-two-phrases-put-into-two-phrases</h2>
<p>Generates two lists of integers and puts them into the definitions of the third and fourth phrases.&nbsp; Every possible combination of two integers is generated, with the first two phrases supplying to lists of numbers.&nbsp; For example, if the first phrase contains <b><i>-2-1 0 1 2</i></b> and the second phrase contains <b><i>12 17 32 55</i></b> then the third phrase will contain <b><i>-2 -2 -2 -2 -1 -1 -1 -1 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 2</i></b> and the fourth phrase will contain <b><i>12 17 32 55 12 17 32 55 12 17 32 55 12 17 32 55 12 17 32 55</i></b> .</p>


<h2>write-all-phrase-names-to-phrase</h2>
<p>Puts into the definition of the second phrase the names (but not the definitions) of all currently defined phrases.</p>


<h2>createlist-first-yes-or-no</h2>
<p>When this appears in a list-generation template (see <b><i>use-template-and-parameters-to-create-simple-list-with-name</i></b> for details), this phrase is defined as <b><i>yes</i></b> if the list item is the first item in the list, or it is defined as <b><i>no</i></b> otherwise.&nbsp; Outside of a list-generation template this value is not predictable.</p>


<h2>createlist-item-next</h2>
<p>This phrase name is reserved.&nbsp; (It is used internally during the creation of a list.)</p>


<h2>createlist-item-number</h2>
<p>When this appears in a list-generation template (see <b><i>use-template-and-parameters-to-create-simple-list-with-name</i></b> for details), this phrase is defined as the number of the item in the list, with the first item being numbered <b><i>1</i></b>.&nbsp; Outside of a list-generation template this value is not predictable.</p>


<h2>createlist-last-yes-or-no</h2>
<p>When this appears in a list-generation template (see <b><i>use-template-and-parameters-to-create-simple-list-with-name</i></b> for details), this phrase is defined as <b><i>yes</i></b> if the list item is the last item in the list, or it is defined as <b><i>no</i></b> otherwise.&nbsp; Outside of a list-generation template this value is not predictable.</p>


<h2>createlist-parameter</h2>
<p>When this appears in a list-generation template (see <b><i>use-template-and-parameters-to-create-simple-list-with-name</i></b> for details), this phrase is defined as the current parameter, which is different for each item in the generated list.</p>


<h2>createlist-total-number-of-items</h2>
<p>When a list is being generated by the action <b><i>use-template-and-parameters-to-create-simple-list-with-name</i></b> or the action <b><i>use-template-and-parameters-to-create-full-list-with-name</i></b> this phrase equals the total number of items in the generated list.&nbsp; This value is not predictable outside of list generation.&nbsp; This phrase loses its expected value when a different list (such as a sub-list) is generated, so the value should be copied to another phrase before starting to generate a different list.</p>


<h1>Phrases for handling (phrase) definitions</h1>


<h2>clear-all-dashrep-phrases</h2>
<p>Clears all the definitions of all the phrases.&nbsp; Remember that this action resets every definition of every phrase, except the phrases that are defined internally.</p>


<h2>dashrep-phrase-prefix-for-imported-phrases</h2>
<p>A prefix placed at the beginning of each newly defined phrase imported from a file.&nbsp; This capability is useful for preventing user-written phrase names from overwriting phrase names that are executed with special permissions.&nbsp; Also this capability is useful for importing phrases from separate files that otherwise might have overlapping phrase names.</p>


<h2>dashrep-phrase-suffix-for-imported-phrases</h2>
<p>A suffix placed at the end of each newly defined phrase imported from a file.&nbsp; See the phrase <b><i>prefix-for-imported-phrases</i></b> for more details.</p>


<h2>dashrep-yes-append-not-replace-for-imported-phrases</h2>
<p>If this phrase equals <b><i>yes</i></b> , and if a phrase definition is being imported from a file and that phrase has the same name as an existing phrase, then the definition is appended to the end of the existing definition, rather than replacing the existing definition.&nbsp; This capability is useful when multiple files contain phrase definitions with the same names, and those definitions artists that should be combined.</p>


<h2>export-defs-all-begin</h2>
<p>If the phrase <b><i>dashrep-yes-or-no-export-delimited-definitions</i></b> equals <b><i>yes</i></b> when the action <b><i>write-all-dashrep-definitions-to-file</i></b> or <b><i>write-all-dashrep-phrase-names-to-file</i></b> or <b><i>write-dashrep-definitions-listed-in-phrase-to-file</i></b> is used, this phrase name (enclosed in brackets) is inserted at the beginning of all the written-to-a-file phrase definitions.&nbsp; This capability is useful if the written definitions need to be translated into a different format.</p>


<h2>export-defs-all-end</h2>
<p>If the phrase <b><i>dashrep-yes-or-no-export-delimited-definitions</i></b> equals <b><i>yes</i></b> when the <b><i>write-all-dashrep-definitions-to-file</i></b> or <b><i>write-all-dashrep-phrase-names-to-file</i></b> or <b><i>write-dashrep-definitions-listed-in-phrase-to-file</i></b> action is used, this phrase name (enclosed in brackets) is inserted at the end of all the written-to-a-file phrase definitions.&nbsp; This capability is useful if the written definitions need to be translated into a different format.</p>


<h2>export-defs-def-begin</h2>
<p>If the phrase <b><i>dashrep-yes-or-no-export-delimited-definitions</i></b> equals <b><i>yes</i></b> when the <b><i>write-all-dashrep-definitions-to-file</i></b> or <b><i>write-all-dashrep-phrase-names-to-file</i></b> or <b><i>write-dashrep-definitions-listed-in-phrase-to-file</i></b> action is used, this phrase name (enclosed in brackets) is inserted at the beginning of each definition.&nbsp; (A separate phrase is inserted at the beginning of the phrase name).&nbsp; This capability is useful if the written definitions need to be translated into a different format.</p>


<h2>export-defs-def-end</h2>
<p>If the phrase <b><i>dashrep-yes-or-no-export-delimited-definitions</i></b> equals <b><i>yes</i></b> when the <b><i>write-all-dashrep-definitions-to-file</i></b> or <b><i>write-all-dashrep-phrase-names-to-file</i></b> or <b><i>write-dashrep-definitions-listed-in-phrase-to-file</i></b> action is used, this phrase name (enclosed in brackets) is inserted at the end of each definition.&nbsp; (A separate phrase is inserted at the end of the phrase name).&nbsp; This capability is useful if the written definitions need to be translated into a different format.</p>


<h2>export-defs-phrase-begin</h2>
<p>If the phrase <b><i>dashrep-yes-or-no-export-delimited-definitions</i></b> equals <b><i>yes</i></b> when the <b><i>write-all-dashrep-definitions-to-file</i></b> or <b><i>write-all-dashrep-phrase-names-to-file</i></b> or <b><i>write-dashrep-definitions-listed-in-phrase-to-file</i></b> action is used, this phrase name (enclosed in brackets) is inserted at the beginning of each phrase name.&nbsp; (A separate phrase is inserted at the beginning of the definition).&nbsp; This capability is useful if the written definitions need to be translated into a different format.</p>


<h2>export-defs-phrase-end</h2>
<p>If the phrase <b><i>dashrep-yes-or-no-export-delimited-definitions</i></b> equals <b><i>yes</i></b> when the <b><i>write-all-dashrep-definitions-to-file</i></b> or <b><i>write-all-dashrep-phrase-names-to-file</i></b> or <b><i>write-dashrep-definitions-listed-in-phrase-to-file</i></b> action is used, this phrase name (enclosed in brackets) is inserted at the end of each phrase name.&nbsp; (A separate phrase is inserted at the end of the definition).&nbsp; This capability is useful if the written definitions need to be translated into a different format.</p>


<h2>list-of-phrases-newly-defined</h2>
<p>Contains a list of all the hyphenated phrases that have been imported or defined.&nbsp; This definition can be cleared to limit the list to phrases that were imported or defined after the definition was cleared.</p>


<h2>dashrep-yes-or-no-export-delimited-definitions</h2>
<p>If it equals <b><i>yes</i></b> then the action [ <b><i>...</i></b> ] inserts special hyphenated phrases into the exported definitions.&nbsp; Otherwise exported definitions are written using the normal Dashrep convention.&nbsp; This capability enables the exported definitions to be converted into special formats such as HTML or XML.</p>


<h1>File-related phrases</h1>


<h2>dashrep-path-prefix-for-file-reading</h2>
<p>Specifies a different (non-local-folder) path for file read operations.&nbsp; If this definition is empty, the local directory is used.&nbsp; If a path prefix is included with any of the file-reading actions, that path is ignored and this path is used.&nbsp; This approach limits the chances of intentional or accidental access to files that should not be accessed.&nbsp; A different path is used for file-writing actions.</p>


<h2>dashrep-path-prefix-for-file-writing</h2>
<p>Specifies a different (non-local-folder) path for file write operations.&nbsp; If this definition is empty, the local directory is used.&nbsp; If a path prefix is included with any of the file-writing actions, that path is ignored and this path is used.&nbsp; This approach limits the chances of intentional or accidental access to files that should not be accessed.&nbsp; A different path is used for file-reading actions.</p>


<h2>copy-from-phrase-append-to-file</h2>
<p>Copies the definition of the hyphenated phrase onto the end of the specified file.</p>


<h2>expand-phrase-to-file</h2>
<p>Does a Dashrep translation of the specified phrase (which is the first item after this action name) and then writes the results to the named file (which is the second item after this action).</p>


<h2>copy-from-file-to-phrase</h2>
<p>Copies the text in the specified file to the definition of the specified hyphenated phrase (without preserving the previous definition).&nbsp; The phrase <b><i>no</i></b> can be defined as <i>yes</i> to insert the phrase <b><i>end-of-line-here</i></b> at each line break that is encountered.</p>


<h2>copy-from-file-to-phrases-line-numbered</h2>
<p>Reads from the specified file all the lines in that text file, and puts each line into a separate phrase definition.&nbsp; For each line its phrase name begins with the specified name and ends with the line number.&nbsp; In addition this action creates a phrase that contains a list of the line numbers, with this phrase being named starting with <b><i>list-of-line-numbers-for-list-named-</i></b> and ending with the list name.&nbsp; The file must be in the directory specified by the phrase <b><i>dashrep-path-prefix-for-file-reading</i></b>.&nbsp; This action is useful for accessing text files that do not contain Dashrep definitions.&nbsp; If the text is in spreadsheet-like columns, the action [ <b><i>...</i></b> ] can be used instead.</p>


<h2>put-into-phrase-list-of-files-in-current-read-directory</h2>
<p>Put into the specified phrase a list of all the files that are in the current directory, where the current directory is specified by the value of phrase <b><i>dashrep-path-prefix-for-file-reading</i></b>.&nbsp; If the directory names are also needed, use the action [ <b><i>...</i></b> ] or the action [ <b><i>...</i></b> ].</p>


<h2>yes-or-no-file-exists</h2>
<p>Determines whether the specified file exists, and sets the phrase <b><i>yes-or-no-specified-file-exists</i></b> to either <i>yes</i> or <i>no</i> to indicate the result.</p>


<h2>size-of-file</h2>
<p>Gets the file size &mdash; in bytes &mdash; of the specified file.&nbsp; The current value of the phrase <b><i>dashrep-path-prefix-for-file-reading</i></b> specifies the path name (including the directory name) in which to look for the specified file.</p>


<h2>modification-time-of-file</h2>
<p>Gets the modification time &mdash; in epoch seconds &mdash; of the specified file.&nbsp; The current value of the phrase <b><i>dashrep-path-prefix-for-file-reading</i></b> specifies the path name (including the directory name) in which to look for the specified file.</p>


<h2>create-empty-file</h2>
<p>Creates an empty file using the specified file name, and erases the file if it already exists.</p>


<h2>delete-file</h2>
<p>Deletes the specified file.</p>


<h2>find-line-in-file-that-begins-with-phrase</h2>
<p>Reads the specified file (which must be a text file) and looks for a line that begins with the same text as the definition of the specified phrase.&nbsp; The file must be in the directory specified by the phrase <b><i>dashrep-path-prefix-for-file-reading</i></b>.&nbsp; This action is useful for quickly finding a matching hyphenated phrase without importing all the phrases in that file.</p>


<h2>write-all-dashrep-definitions-to-file</h2>
<p>Writes all the Dashrep definitions to a new file with the specified file name, and erases the file if it already exists.&nbsp; By default the definitions are written in Dashrep-readable format, which means the phrase being defined appears first, then is followed by the definition, and multiple dashes terminate the definition.&nbsp; If the <b><i></i></b> phrase is set to <i>yes</i> , the exported definitions are delimited by the following phrases at appropriate positions: <b><i>export-defs-all-begin</i></b> , <b><i>export-defs-all-end</i></b> , <b><i>export-defs-phrase-begin</i></b> , <b><i>export-defs-phrase-end</i></b> , <b><i>export-defs-def-begin</i></b> , and <b><i>export-defs-def-end</i></b>.&nbsp; This special format allows a separate Dashrep translation to convert the written definitions into code such as HTML, XML, or SQL.</p>


<h2>write-all-dashrep-phrase-names-to-file</h2>
<p>Writes all the Dashrep phrase names to a new file with the specified file name, and erases the file if it already exists.</p>


<h2>write-dashrep-definitions-listed-in-phrase-to-file</h2>
<p>Writes (in Dashrep-readable form) the definitions of the phrases that are named in the definition of the phrase that follows this action name, and writes those definitions to the named file that follows the specified phrase.</p>


<h2>get-definitions-from-file</h2>
<p>Reads the Dashrep definitions from the specified file, and overwrites any existing definitions that have the same phrase name.</p>


<h2>linewise-translate-from-file-to-file</h2>
<p>Translates, one line at a time, the text from the specified input file into the specified result file, using the currently defined Dashrep phrase definitions.&nbsp; All Dashrep translations, including parameters and special phrases, are performed.&nbsp; The source file must be in the directory specified by the phrase <b><i>dashrep-path-prefix-for-file-reading</i></b>, and the target file will be created in the directory specified by the phrase <b><i>dashrep-path-prefix-for-file-writing</i></b>.</p>


<h2>linewise-translate-parameters-only-from-file-to-file</h2>
<p>Same as the <b><i>linewise-translate-from-file-to-file</i></b> action except that only the parameters are expanded.&nbsp; This means that phrases that are not enclosed in the square-bracket notation are not expanded.</p>


<h2>linewise-translate-phrases-only-from-file-to-file</h2>
<p>Same as the <b><i>linewise-translate-from-file-to-file</i></b> action except that only phrases are expanded, and actions in the square-bracket notation are not handled.</p>


<h2>linewise-translate-special-phrases-only-from-file-to-file</h2>
<p>Translates, one line at a time, the text from the specified input file into the specified result file, but only translates special Dashrep phrases such as <b><i>no-space</i></b> and <b><i>ignore-begin</i></b> and <b><i>non-breaking-spaces-begin</i></b>.</p>


<h2>copy-from-columns-in-file-to-named-phrases</h2>
<p>Reads from the specified file all the spreadsheet-like lines of text, and puts each (space-delimited) word into a phrase that has a special name.&nbsp; The specified phrase contains both the prefix for all the names and the name of each column.&nbsp; For example, if the specified phrase is defined as <b><i>cell-contents-for-nickname- phone-number city state</i></b> and one line of text in the file is <b><i>flipper 123-456-7890 san-diego ca</i></b> then the phrase <b><i>cell-contents-for-nickname-flipper-phone-number</i></b> will contain <b><i>123-456-7890</i></b> and the phrase [ <b><i>...</i></b> ] will contain [ <b><i>...</i></b> ] and the phrase [ <b><i>...</i></b> ] will contain [ <b><i>...</i></b> ] .&nbsp; As with all file-access actions, the file must be in the directory specified by the phrase <b><i>dashrep-path-prefix-for-file-reading</i></b>.&nbsp; This action is useful for reading spreadsheet-like data.&nbsp; The phrase [ <b><i>...</i></b> ] can be useful if any spreadsheet-like cell of data contains any spaces.</p>


<h2>dashrep-use-two-spaces-as-column-delimiter</h2>
<p>Requests that the action [ <b><i>...</i></b> ] regards two adjacent spaces as the delimiter between words.&nbsp; Without this adjustment that action regards a single space as the delimiter between words.&nbsp; This adjustment enables the text in any column of (text) data to contain single spaces.&nbsp; This adjustment avoids the complications that arise from using a tab character as a column delimiter, such as in exported spreadsheet data.</p>


<h2>dashrep-list-files-directories-both</h2>
<p>Put into the specified phrase a list of all the files and directories ("folders") in the current directory, where the current directory is specified by the value of phrase <b><i>dashrep-path-prefix-for-file-reading</i></b>.&nbsp; If only the file names are needed, use the action [ <b><i>...</i></b> ] , or if only the directory names are needed, use the action [ <b><i>...</i></b> ] .</p>


<h2>dashrep-permission-to-append-to-files-yes-or-no</h2>
<p>If it equals <b><i>yes</i></b> then actions have permission to append to existing files.&nbsp; Any other value indicates that actions do not have this permission.&nbsp; This value can be changed as needed.&nbsp; For security purposes this value should be set to <b><i>no</i></b> before translating (or expanding) Dashrep code that might be tainted by outside users.</p>


<h2>dashrep-permission-to-delete-or-overwrite-files-yes-or-no</h2>
<p>If it equals <b><i>yes</i></b> then actions have permission to delete or overwrite existing files.&nbsp; Any other value indicates that actions do not have these permissions.&nbsp; This value can be changed as needed.&nbsp; For security purposes this value should be set to <b><i>no</i></b> before translating (or expanding) Dashrep code that might be tainted by outside users.</p>


<h1>XML-import phrases</h1>


<h2>linewise-translate-xml-tags-in-file-to-dashrep-phrases-in-file</h2>
<p>Translates XML in the specified input file into Dashrep phrases and puts the results in the specified output file.&nbsp; In the resulting text, phrase names are inserted where XML tags appeared.&nbsp; XML tags are converted into phrase names, where the phrase name is a concatenation (joined version) of the XML tag names.&nbsp; For example, <b><i>begin-xml-peoplelist-person-name</i></b> and <b><i>end-xml-peoplelist-person-name</i></b> surrounds text that was tagged with the XML tag structure <b><i><xml><peoplelist><person><name></i></b>.&nbsp; The prefix <b><i>begin-and-end-</i></b> is used for self-terminating XML tags such as <b><i><br /></i></b> .&nbsp; If the resulting phrase is defined, the definition is inserted instead.&nbsp; If the non-tag content contains any hyphens, they are replaced with the phrase <b><i>hyphen-here</i></b> .&nbsp; If a tag's opening bracket (<) and closing bracket (>) are not both on the same line, the tag will not be recognized.&nbsp; The resulting file, combined with appropriate definitions for those phrase names, enables an XML or XHTML file to be converted into nearly any kind of text file.</p>


<h2>dashrep-first-xml-tag-name</h2>
<p>Supplies an XML tag name (without angle brackets) to the <i>linewise-translate-xml-tags-in-file-to-dashrep-phrases-in-file</i> action to indicate the first XML tag to be recognized.&nbsp; Tags at higher levels within the XML structure are ignored.&nbsp; This tag name becomes the first tag name in the generated phrase names.</p>


<h2>dashrep-list-of-xml-phrases</h2>
<p>contains a list of all the phrase names that were written by the <i>linewise-translate-xml-tags-in-file-to-dashrep-phrases-in-file</i> action.</p>


<h2>dashrep-xml-level-reset-if-zero</h2>
<p>If it equals <b><i>0</i></b> (zero) then the XML handling process resets the translation process so that another XML file can be processed without being affected by effects that arose during the previous translation.</p>


<h2>dashrep-xml-trace-on-or-off</h2>
<p>If it equals <b><i>on</i></b> then XML translations write "trace" messages to the phrase [ <b><i>...</i></b> ] for debugging purposes.&nbsp; Otherwise such "trace" messages are not written.</p>


<h2>dashrep-xml-yes-ignore-if-no-tag-replacement</h2>
<p>If it equals <b><i>yes</i></b> then XML translations ignore data that would be tagged with a hyphenated phrase that is not defined.&nbsp; For example, if the context for XML data is <b><i><xml><dolphin><firstname>Flipper</firstname></dolphin></xml></i></b> and the phrase <b><i>xml-dolphin-firstname</i></b> has not been defined, then this XML data is ignored.&nbsp; The match is case sensitive, which means that a defined phrase of <b><i>XML-Dolphin-Firstname</i></b> would not be sufficient to capture the data in this example.</p>


<h1>HTML-output phrases</h1>


<h2>dashrep-html-replacement-ampersand</h2>
<p>Specifies the text that inserted as a replacement for the ampersand (&) character when the action [ <b><i>...</i></b> ] is used.</p>


<h2>dashrep-html-replacement-apostrophe</h2>

<h2>dashrep-html-replacement-quotation-mark</h2>
<p>Specifies the text that inserted as a replacement for the ampersand (&) character when the action [ <b><i>...</i></b> ] is used.</p>


<h1>Ignore and capture directives</h1>


<h2>ignore-begin-here</h2>

<h2>ignore-end-here</h2>
<p>See description of <b><i>ignore-begin-here</i></b>.</p>


<h2>capture-begin-here</h2>
<p>Requests that the text following this phrase, but before the <b><i>capture-end-here</i></b> phrase be captured and put into the definition of the phrase named <b><i>captured-text</i></b> .&nbsp; The <b><i>capture-begin-here</i></b> and <b><i>capture-end-here</i></b> phrases can be nested, but the captured text becomes unpredictable.&nbsp; These phrases cannot overlap the <b><i>ignore-begin-here</i></b> and <b><i>ignore-begin-here</i></b> phrases.</p>


<h2>capture-end-here</h2>
<p>See description of <b><i>capture-begin-here</i></b>.</p>


<h2>captured-text</h2>
<p>Stores the text that is captured by the <b><i>capture-begin-here</i></b> and <b><i>capture-end-here</i></b> directives.</p>


<h2>dashrep-ignore-actions-off-else-on</h2>
<p>If this phrase contains <b><i>off</i></b> (and no other text), the <b><i>ignore-begin-here</i></b> and <b><i>ignore-end-here</i></b> directives.&nbsp; This capability is needed if the text contains documentation about these Dashrep phrases.</p>


<h2>dashrep-capture-actions-off-else-on</h2>
<p>If this phrase contains <b><i>off</i></b> (and no other text), the <b><i>capture-begin-here</i></b> and <b><i>capture-end-here</i></b> directives.&nbsp; This capability is needed if the text contains documentation about these Dashrep phrases.</p>


<h2>dashrep-capture-level</h2>
<p>Indicates the nesting level for the <b><i>capture-begin-here</i></b> and <b><i>capture-end-here</i></b> directives.&nbsp; In addition to reading these values for debugging purposes, this nesting level can be assigned a value, which is useful if one translation sequence is being interrupted by another translation sequence and there is a need to restore the nesting level to the value it had prior to this interruption.</p>


<h2>dashrep-ignore-level</h2>
<p>Indicates the nesting level for the <b><i>ignore-begin-here</i></b> and <b><i>ignore-end-here</i></b> directives.&nbsp; In addition to reading these values for debugging purposes, this nesting level can be assigned a value, which is useful if one translation sequence is being interrupted by another translation sequence and there is a need to restore the nesting level to the value it had prior to this interruption.</p>


<h1>Copy and append phrases</h1>


<h2>copy-from-phrase-to-phrase</h2>
<p>Copies the definition of the first phrase into the definition of the second phrase.&nbsp; This action is useful in situations where the text includes hyphens, line breaks, multiple adjacent spaces and any other text that cannot be assigned using the equal-sign approach.</p>


<h2>append-from-phrase-to-phrase</h2>
<p>Appends the definition of the first phrase to the end of the definition of the second phrase, and inserts a single space between the existing text and the appended text.</p>

<h2>copy-from-phrase-to-phrase-only-word-at-position</h2>
<p>Copies one word from the definition of the first phrase into the definition of the second phrase, with the word position being specified by a number.&nbsp; A position number of 1 indicates the first word in the definition.&nbsp; The words are any sequence of characters that does not include a space, and spaces are regarded as the separation between each pair of words.</p>


<h2>copy-from-phrase-to-phrase-split-into-words-at-string-in-phrase</h2>
<p>Splits text at the positions where the specified text string appears, with the results being placed into the definition of the second phrase.&nbsp; For example, if the third string contains the slash character (/), and the first ring contains the text <b><i>path/name/folder/name</i></b>, the second phrase would be defined as <b><i>path name folder name</i></b>.&nbsp; This action allows the individual words to be accessed independently using one of the word-based actions.</p>


<h2>copy-from-phrase-to-phrase-remove-first-word-from-phrase</h2>
<p>Copies a phrase definition to the specified phrase, and removes the first word.</p>

<h2>copy-from-phrase-to-phrase-and-replace-digits-with-9s</h2>
<p>Copies the definition of the first phrase into the definition of the second phrase, but replaces any digit with the digit nine (</i></b> 9</i></b>).&nbsp; This action simplifies the process of recognizing specific patterns of numbers and symbols.&nbsp; For example, the text <b><i>123-456-7890</i></b> becomes <b><i>999-999-9999</i></b> and the result can be checked for to see if it matches recognizable or acceptable patterns.</p>


<h2>copy-from-phrase-to-phrase-lowercase-only</h2>
<p>Copies the definition of first phrase into the definition of the second phrase, but changes any uppercase characters (such as <b><i>A</i></b> and <b><i>B</i></b>) into lowercase characters (such as <b><i>a</i></b> and <b><i>b</i></b>).</p>


<h2>copy-from-phrase-to-phrase-from-spoken-dashrep-code</h2>

<h2>copy-numbers-from-phrase-to-phrase-and-sort</h2>
<p>[...]</p>


<h1>Debugging-support phrases</h1>


<h2>dashrep-comments-ignored</h2>
<p>Contains text that the translation process identified to be comments.&nbsp; Comments are contained within the text strings <b><i>*---</i></b> and <b><i>---*</i></b>, but these strings cannot be nested, so this definition can be useful for debugging purposes.</p>


<h2>dashrep-stop-translation</h2>
<p>Stops the Dashrep translation process if the value is <b><i>yes</i></b> .&nbsp; This phrase also is used internally as part of the (not-yet-implemented) action [ <b><i>...</i></b> ].</p>


<h2>dashrep-capture-trace-on-or-off</h2>
<p>If this phrase contains the word <b><i>on</i></b> (and no other text), then the "trace" messages that track the <b><i>capture-begin-here</i></b> and <b><i>capture-end-here</i></b> directives are written to the <b><i>debug-trace-log</i></b> phrase.&nbsp; If this phrase contains anything other than the word <b><i>on</i></b>, no such messages are written.</p>


<h2>dashrep-debug-trace-log</h2>
<p>Stores the "trace" messages that are generated when those "trace" messages are requested.&nbsp; This information is useful for debugging, and it is automatically included if all the definitions are written to a file as the last translation step.</p>


<h2>dashrep-debug-trace-on-or-off</h2>
<p>If this phrase contains the word <b><i>on</i></b> (and no other text), then the "trace" messages that track some translation activities are written to the <b><i>debug-trace-log</i></b> phrase.&nbsp; If this phrase contains anything other than the word <b><i>on</i></b>, no such messages are written.&nbsp; Tip: Activate this (or any) tracing just before the Dashrep code that is producing unexpected results.</p>


<h2>dashrep-action-trace-on-or-off</h2>
<p>If this phrase contains the word <b><i>on</i></b> (and no other text), then the "trace" messages that track named actions are written to the <b><i>debug-trace-log</i></b> phrase.&nbsp; If this phrase contains anything other than the word <b><i>on</i></b>, no such messages are written.&nbsp; Tip: Activate this (or any) tracing just before the Dashrep code that is producing unexpected results.</p>


<h2>dashrep-ignore-trace-on-or-off</h2>
<p>If this phrase contains the word <b><i>on</i></b> (and no other text), then the "trace" messages that track the <b><i>ignore-begin-here</i></b> and <b><i>ignore-end-here</i></b> directives are written to the <b><i>debug-trace-log</i></b> phrase.&nbsp; If this phrase contains anything other than the word <b><i>on</i></b>, no such messages are written.</p>


<h2>dashrep-linewise-trace-on-or-off</h2>
<p>If this phrase contains the word <b><i>on</i></b> (and no other text), then the "trace" messages that track linewise translations are written to the <b><i>debug-trace-log</i></b> phrase.&nbsp; If this phrase contains anything other than the word <b><i>on</i></b>, no such messages are written.</p>


<h1>Advanced phrases</h1>


<h2>dashrep-endless-loop-counter-limit</h2>
<p>Specifies the maximum number of replacement loops allowed during a Dashrep translation.&nbsp; This number can be redefined such as to a larger number.&nbsp; If this limit is exceeded, Dashrep translation is stopped and an error message indicates which phrase was replaced the most number of times.&nbsp; If large amounts of data are processed, the default number is not going to be large enough.&nbsp; This limit interrupts endless loops, which can occur if a phrase is defined in a way that (either directly or indirectly) includes its own name.</p>


<h2>unique-value</h2>
<p>Assigns a unique value to the specified phrase.&nbsp; Currently this action is the equivalent to the <b><i>auto-increment</i></b> action, but future versions may use non-sequential numbers (to accomodate parallel processing).</p>


<h2>escape-if-yes</h2>
<p>If the text that follows equals <b><i>yes</i></b> then this action interrupts the translation process and exits from the Dashrep engine.&nbsp; This capability allows switching between executable code in the host language (which is currently Perl) and translating Dashrep code.&nbsp; When this interruption occurs, the text that was being translated is placed into the phrase <b><i>escape-text</i></b> .&nbsp; If no complications arise, the non-Dashrep executable code can resume Dashrep translation by supplying the <b><i>escape-text</i></b> definition as the text to be translated.&nbsp; (One of the expected uses of this action is to implement something similar to a "make" file.)</p>


<h2>escape-if-no</h2>
<p>The <b><i>no</i></b> equivalent of the <b><i>escape-if-yes</i></b> action.&nbsp; See that phrase description for details.</p>


<h2>dashrep-backwards-compatibility-keep-spaces-in-parameter-yes-or-no</h2>
<p>If it equals <b><i>yes</i></b> then backward compatibility is retained for actions and conventions that have been changed recently.</p>


<h2>dashrep-special-replacement-adjacent-space</h2>
<p>Specifies the text that is inserted to replace each space when the <b><i>copy-from-phrase-to-phrase-and-replace-adjacent-spaces</i></b> action is used.</p>


<h2>dashrep-special-replacement-hyphen</h2>
<p>Specifies the text that is inserted to replace each hyphen when the <b><i>copy-from-phrase-to-phrase-and-replace-hyphens</i></b> action is used.</p>


<h2>dashrep-special-replacement-newline</h2>
<p>Specifies the text that is inserted to replace each newline (line break) when the <b><i>copy-from-phrase-to-phrase-and-replace-newlines</i></b> action is used.</p>


<h2>dashrep-yes-indicate-line-endings</h2>
<p>If this phrase is defined as <b><i>yes</i></b>, the actions <b><i>copy-from-file-to-phrase</i></b> and <b><i>copy-from-file-to-phrases-line-numbered</i></b> insert the text <b><i>end-of-line-here</i></b> at line-break positions.&nbsp; The <b><i>end-of-line-here</i></b> phrase does not have a default definition.</p>


<h2>begin-and-end</h2>
<p>[...]</p>


<h2>insert-phrase-with-brackets-after-next-top-line</h2>
<p>During one of the <b><i>linewise</i></b> actions this phrase effectively inserts the specified hyphenated phrase after the next line of text being handled linewise, and that inserted phrase is enclosed within parameter brackets.&nbsp; This action enables the next line of text to be captured and placed into another phrase, and then the captured text can be used as desired.</p>

<h1>Language Perspective</h1>

<h2>Functionality</h2>

<p>Although Dashrep code is not directly executable, it can generate executable code.&nbsp; Although it does not directly define loops, it generates lists in which any space-delimited list of text strings (including integers) can specify the unique values for the list items.&nbsp; Although the Dashrep language does not directly implement a branching structure, the translated code can be completely changed at any level (including within lists) based on parameterized hyphenated phrases such as <b><i>[-template-for-move-proposal-link-for-action-[-output-requested-action-]-]</i></b>.&nbsp; Also, Dashrep code makes it easier to move data out of executable code (where data does not belong).</p>


<a name="goals"></a>
<h2>Dashrep design goals</h2>

<ul>

<li>Provide a convenient way to move data out of executable code.&nbsp; This functionality fills a gap that exists in Perl and many other executable programming languages.&nbsp; The separation of data from executable code has many benefits, including allowing executable code to generate results in any sequence instead of the sequence in which they appear in the final result (such as the sequence of items in an HTML file), isolating layout-specific code that non-programmers can edit, switching between different written languages (such as English and French) just by changing a Dashrep phrase's value (such as from "en" to "fr"), switching between different "skins" or appearances using a single Dashrep phrase value, making it easy to switch between singular and plural forms of a word (such as "person" and "people") based on a data-specific count, and supporting complex layouts that go way beyond what templates can handle.</li>

<li>Keep it simple, and keep it flexible.&nbsp; Only a few characters &mdash; space, hyphen/dash, and in some situations square brackets (if they are adjacent to dashes) &mdash; have special significance.&nbsp; These special characters do not overlap with special characters in coding languages such as HTML, XML, JavaScript, Perl, C++, Python, etc., so the Dashrep language can more easily generate code in most target languages.</li>

<li>Make the language speakable.&nbsp; This provides a step toward bridging the gap between spoken language (e.g. English) which is highly ambiguous (i.e. words, phrases, and sentences can have multiple meanings), and coding languages that are unambiguous.&nbsp; Soon, mobile technology will increase the use of microphones instead of keyboards, and a spoken language such as Dashrep&mdash;in conjunction with a few special words&mdash;can facilitate creating unambiguous content (such as XML-like information, formatted documents, etc.) that computer software can easily interpret.&nbsp; For people with keyboard-related repetitive-stress injury (RSI), a spoken language provides an alternative to typing symbol-intensive code.</li>

</ul>

<a name="history"></a>
<h2>What is the origin of the Dashrep language?</h2>

<p>The Dashrep language was developed by Richard Fobes, author of <i>The Creative Problem Solver's Toolbox</i>, over many years of personal use.&nbsp; A Perl-language, open-source implementation was released on 2009-May-7.</p>

<p>Early versions of the Dashrep language were used to write two books, <i>The Creative Problem Solver's Toolbox</i> and <i>Ending The Hidden Unfairness In U.S. Elections</i>.&nbsp; At <a href="www.VoteFair.org">www.VoteFair.org</a> and <a href="www.NegotiationTool.com">www.NegotiationTool.com</a> Dashrep code is interpreted to dynamically generate each interactive HTML (web) page (with Perl code providing all the executable functionality).&nbsp; The language was used to generate JavaScript code that Adobe Illustrator executed to generate vector graphics for use in the book titled <i>Ending The Hidden Unfairness In U.S. Elections</i>.&nbsp; And an early version of the Dashrep language is still used to generate invoices and packing slips for the publishing business named Solutions Through Innovation.</p>

<p>Obviously the letters &ldquo;dash&rdquo; in the name Dashrep refer to the use of dashes (which are the same as hyphens).&nbsp; Less obviously, the letters &ldquo;rep&rdquo; in the name Dashrep refer to the first letters in the word &ldquo;replace&rdquo; and &ldquo;replacement&rdquo;.</p>
