phrase-description-begin
The word b-b phrase b-e refers to the combination of a b-b phrase name b-e and its associated b-b phrase definition b-e no-space .
line-break line-break
A b-b phrase name b-e is a hyphenated phrase, such as
b-i-b animal hyphen-here type b-i-e no-space .
line-break line-break
A b-b phrase definition b-e is text that is associated with a phrase name.
s-n
For example, the phrase name
b-i-b animal hyphen-here type b-i-e
can have a current definition of
b-i-b dolphin b-i-e no-space .
line-break line-break
A b-b pre hyphen-here defined phrase b-e is a special phrase name for which the Dashrep language supplies a default definition.
s-n
Some pre hyphen-here defined phrases can be re hyphen-here defined,
but others cannot be re hyphen-here defined.
line-break line-break
If a phrase name is encountered within text being translated (or &ldquo;expanded&rdquo;), and if the phrase name has an associated definition, then the phrase definition is inserted where the phrase name appears.
line-break line-break
Normally a phrase name is recognized regardless of whether or not it appears within
an action h-h or h-h replacement clause
&mdash; which begins with the word
b-i-b am no-space bee b-i-e (or equivalent)
and ends with the word
b-i-b am no-space enn b-i-e (or equivalent).
s-n
An exception to this convention occurs when the action b-i-b put h-h into h-h phrase b-i-e is used.

Directive
phrase-heading-end
phrase-description-begin
A b-b directive b-e is a special Dashrep hyphen-here defined phrase name that triggers a special functionality in the translation.
s-n
Directives are not recognized if they appear between the paired words
b-i-b am no-space bee b-i-e (or equivalent) and b-i-b am no-space enn b-i-e (or equivalent).

Action
phrase-heading-end
phrase-description-begin
An b-b action b-e is a special Dashrep hyphen-here defined phrase name that has special significance when it immediately follows the word b-i-b am no-space bee b-i-e (or equivalent).
s-n
An action is not recognized if it does not immediately follow the word b-i-b am no-space bee b-i-e (or equivalent).
line-break line-break
Most actions must be followed by one or more b-b operands b-e no-space .
s-n
Typically an operand is either a phrase name,
or a space hyphen-here delimited word,
or a group of words delimited by b-i-b am no-space bee b-i-e and b-i-b am no-space bee b-i-e (or equivalents).
s-n
An action uses the operands to determine exactly what to do.

Analogies to spoken languages
phrase-heading-end
phrase-description-begin
The word b-i-b am no-space bee b-i-e is analogous to saying &ldquo;begin sentence,&rdquo;
an action is analogous to a verb (as if it were the first word in the sentence),
an inner group of words that begins with
b-i-b am no-space bee b-i-e
and ends with
b-i-b am no-space enn b-i-e
is analogous to a &ldquo;clause,&rdquo;
and the final word b-i-b am no-space enn b-i-e
is analogous to saying &ldquo;period&rdquo; (or &ldquo;end sentence &rdquo;).

description-for-phrase-yes-or-no-skip-empty-lines-when-copy-from-file:
If this phrase equals b-i-b yes b-i-e then the action b-i-b copy h-h from h-h file h-h to h-h phrase b-i-e skips empty lines. s-n Any other value for this phrase causes empty lines to be included in the copied text. s-n The default value of this phrase is b-i-b yes b-i-e no-space . s-n If a line contains only spaces, it is regarded as an empty line.
----

description-for-phrase-end-of-line-indicator:
This phrase is inserted at the end of each line when the action b-i-b copy h-h from h-h file h-h to h-h phrase b-i-e is used. s-n The definition of this phrase can be changed at any time, and the next use of the action b-i-b copy h-h from h-h file h-h to h-h phrase b-i-e will use the current definition. s-n This phrase has a default definition of a single newline character. s-n Typically the phrases that are copied to this phrase are b-i-b character h-h space b-i-e no-space , b-i-b character h-h newline b-i-e no-space , and b-i-b text h-h end h-h of h-h line h-h here h-h space h-h delimited b-i-e no-space .
-----

description-for-phrase-text-end-of-line-here-space-delimited:
This pre h-h defined phrase contains the text b-i-b text h-h end h-h of h-h line h-h here b-i-e and contains a leading space and a trailing space. s-n When this text is copied into the phrase b-i-b end h-h of h-h line h-h indicator b-i-e no-space , use of the action b-i-b copy h-h from h-h file h-h to h-h phrase b-i-e inserts this special phrase into the text at each newline location, which can assist in inserting anything into those positions when the text is expanded. s-n This phrase is not protected from being overwitten, so its definition can change.
-----

description-for-phrase-yes-or-no-trim-spaces-when-copy-from-file:
If this phrase equals b-i-b yes b-i-e then the action b-i-b copy h-h from h-h file h-h to h-h file b-i-e removes the leading and trailing spaces from each line that is read from the file. s-n Any other value for this phrase causes the leading and trailing spaces to be retained. s-n The default value of this phrase is b-i-b yes b-i-e no-space .
-----

description-for-phrase-delayed-nospace:
This phrase is not defined, but this name is reserved for use as a placeholder where the phrase b-i-b no h-h space b-i-e needs to be inserted later, after other replacements have been done. s-n When ready, this phrase should be defined as b-i-b no h-h space b-i-e just before the final translation step.
-----

description-for-phrase-delayed-newline:
This phrase is not defined, but this name is reserved for use as a placeholder where the phrase b-i-b new h-h line b-i-e needs to be inserted later, after other replacements have been done. s-n Normally this phrase is not needed because the text b-i-b <new_ no-space line> b-i-e serves this purpose. s-n When this phrase is used, this phrase should be defined as b-i-b new h-h line b-i-e just before the final translation step.
-----

description-for-phrase-character-hyphen:
This pre h-h defined phrase contains one hyphen character
( no-space
b-i-b h-h b-i-e
no-space ).
-----

description-for-phrase-character-newline:
This pre h-h defined phrase contains a newline character. s-n
In some other programming languages this character is represented by the text
bold-begin \ no-space italics-begin n b-i-e
no-space .
-----

description-for-phrase-operating-system-slash-or-backslash:
This pre h-h defined phrase contains a slash character
( no-space b-i-b / b-i-e no-space )
if the operating system is not a Microsoft Windows operating h-h system,
and it contains a backslash
( no-space b-i-b \ b-i-e no-space )
if the operating system is a Microsoft Windows operating h-h system.
-----

description-for-phrase-character-space:
This pre h-h defined phrase contains one space character.
-----

description-for-phrase-character-tab:
This pre h-h defined phrase contains a tab character. s-n
In some other programming languages this character is represented by the text
bold-begin \ no-space italics-begin t b-i-e
no-space .
-----

description-for-phrase-character-underscore:
This pre h-h defined phrase contains one underscore character
( no-space
b-i-b _ b-i-e
no-space ).
-----

description-for-phrase-get-characters-from-position-to-position:
This action gets the characters from the specified phrase starting at the position indicated by the first number, and ending at the position indicated by the second number. s-n The character positions are numbered starting with 1 at the first character position. s-n If the second number is greater than the number of characters, then the entire remainder of the phrase is retrieved (which means that using a large second number such as 9999 eliminates needing to know how many characters are in the phrase).
-----

description-for-phrase-copy-words-sort-alphabetic:
This action gets the space hyphen-here delimited words in the first phrase, and sorts those words alphabetically, and puts those sorted words into the second phrase. s-n The two phrase names can be the same.
paragraph-next
Example: If the first phrase contains the text b-i-b dolphin whale seal b-i-e then the text placed into the second phrase will be b-i-b dolphin seal whale b-i-e no-space .
-----

description-for-phrase-encode-as-cgi-parameter:
This action converts symbols and other non hyphen-here alphabetic and non hyphen-here digit characters into the special format that allows the text to be passed to a web server as a CGI parameter. s-n As an example, a comma is represented as b-b %2c b-e no-space . s-n The two phrase names can be the same.
-----

description-for-phrase-decode-from-cgi-parameter:
This action converts a CGI parameter into normal (non h-h encoded) characters. sentence-next This action is the inverse of the b-i-b copy h-h from h-h phrase h-h to h-h phrase h-h and h-h encode h-h as h-h cgi h-h parameter b-i-e action. s-n As an example, the text b-b %2c b-e is converted into a space character. s-n The two phrase names can be the same.
-----

description-for-phrase-copy-without-extra-spaces:
This action removes multiple adjacent spaces so that only single spaces occur, and removes all spaces at the beginning and end of the text. s-n The first phrase specifies the source text, and the second phrase specifies the destination. s-n The two phrase names can be the same.
-----

description-for-phrase-copy-and-remove-attributes-from-xml-tags:
This action removes attributes from XML and HTML tags, and also removes RSS h-h style b-i-b CDATA b-i-e strings. s-n The first phrase specifies the source text, and the second phrase specifies the destination. s-n The two phrase names can be the same.
paragraph-next
Example: If the first and second phrase names are the same, and if the specified phrase contains b-i-b and a &lt;span style="whatever"&gt;dolphin&lt;/span&gt; b-i-e no-space , the modified phrase will contain b-i-b and a &lt;span&gt;dolphin&lt;/span&gt; b-i-e no-space .
paragraph-next
The change assumes that none of the tag's attributes contain a close angle bracket ( no-space b-i-b &gt; b-i-e no-space ). s-n The result is not intended to be valid XML or HTML or RSS code. s-n Instead the intended purpose is to simplify the text as preparation for further manipulations.
-----

description-for-phrase-copy-and-replace:
This action replaces each occurrence of the third phrase with the text in the fourth phrase, based on the text in the first phrase, and places the result into the second phrase. s-n If the replacement phrase contains the search phrase, nothing is changed, and a warning is put into the trace information because that could cause an endless loop. s-n The special phrases b-i-b character hyphen-here space b-i-e and b-i-b character hyphen-here hyphen b-i-e and b-i-b character hyphen-here newline b-i-e are useful here (because the language does not have ways to define those characters). s-n The first two phrase names can be the same.
-----

description-for-phrase-copy-characters-from-position-to-position:
This action copies specified characters from the first phrase to the second phrase. s-n The third and fourth operands indicate the starting and ending character positions, with the first character position being numbered one (1). s-n The starting character position must not be larger than the ending character position. s-n The first two phrase names can be the same.
-----

description-for-phrase-copy-lowercase-only:
This action copies the definition of the first phrase into the definition of the second phrase, but changes any uppercase characters (such as b-i-b A b-i-e and b-i-b B b-i-e no-space ) into lowercase characters (such as b-i-b a b-i-e and b-i-b b b-i-e no-space ). s-n The two phrase names can be the same.
----

description-for-phrase-copy-uppercase-only:
This action copies the definition of the first phrase into the definition of the second phrase, but changes any lowercase characters (such as b-i-b a b-i-e and b-i-b b b-i-e no-space ) into uppercase characters (such as b-i-b A b-i-e and b-i-b B b-i-e no-space ). s-n The two phrase names can be the same.
-----

description-for-phrase-copy-initial-caps:
This action copies the definition of the first phrase into the definition of the second phrase, but changes the first letter of each space hyphen-here delimited word into its equivalent uppercase letter. s-n The remaining letters within the same word are not changed. s-n If the first character after a space is a symbol or digit, that word remains unchanged. s-n If the definition begins with a letter, that letter is converted to uppercase, even though it does not follow a space. s-n The two phrase names can be the same.
-----

description-for-phrase-copy-words-order-reversed:
This action gets the space hyphen-here delimited words in the first phrase, and reverses their order (sequence), and puts those reverse-ordered words into the second phrase. s-n The two phrase names can be the same.
paragraph-next
Example: If the first phrase contains b-i-b dolphin whale octopus b-i-e then the second phrase will contain b-i-b octopus whale dolphin b-i-e no-space .
-----

description-for-phrase-copy-words-from-position-to-position:
This action gets the space hyphen-here delimited words from the first phrase starting at the position indicated by the integer number in the third parameter, and ending at the position indicated by the integer number in the fourth parameter. s-n The word positions are numbered starting with 1 at the beginning. s-n If the ending number is greater than the number of words, then the entire remainder of the phrase is retrieved (which means that using a large second number such as 9999 eliminates needing to know how many words are in the phrase). s-n The first two phrase names can be the same.
-----

description-for-phrase-copy-words-offset-skip:
This action copies some space hyphen-here delimited words from the first phrase to the second phrase using the skip interval specified by the integer number in the fourth operand, starting with the offset integer number specified in the third operand. s-n The skip interval is the distance between copied words. s-n If the offset position and skip interval are both zero, then all the words are copied. s-n The word positions are numbered starting with 1 at the beginning. s-n The first two phrase names can be the same.
paragraph-next
Example: If the first phrase contains b-i-b 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 b-i-e and the third operand is b-i-b 3 b-i-e and the fourth operand is b-i-b 1 b-i-e then the second phrase will contain b-i-b 3 5 7 b-i-e no-space .
-----

description-for-phrase-copy-words-rearrange-using-order-sort-alphabetic:
This action gets the space hyphen-here delimited words in the first phrase, and moves those words into the second phrase using the alphabetical sort order specified by the words in the third phrase. s-n The first two phrase names can be the same.
paragraph-next
Example: If the first phrase contains the text b-i-b Nikola_Tesla Thomas_Jefferson Leonardo_da_Vinci Paul_MacCready b-i-e and the third phrase contains the text b-i-b tesla_nikola jefferson_thomas da_vinci_leonardo maccready_paul b-i-e then the text placed into the second phrase will be b-i-b Leonardo_da_Vinci Thomas_Jefferson Paul_MacCready Nikola_Tesla b-i-e no-space .
-----

description-for-phrase-copy-words-rearrange-using-order-sort-numeric:
This action gets the space hyphen-here delimited words in the first phrase, and moves those words into the second phrase using the numeric sort order specified in the third phrase. s-n The first two phrase names can be the same.
paragraph-next
Example: If the first phrase contains the text b-i-b seven one five three twelve b-i-e and the third phrase contains the text b-i-b 7 1 5 3 12 b-i-e then the text placed into the second phrase will be b-i-b one three five seven twelve b-i-e no-space .
-----

description-for-phrase-get-count-of-characters:
This action counts the number of characters in the definition that is associated with the specified phrase, and supplies the number as its result. s-n Spaces and non-visible characters (such as the newline character) are included in the count.
-----

description-for-phrase-copy-words-that-begin-with-text:
This action looks at all the words in the first phrase and identifies the words that begin with the text in the third phrase, and puts those partially (or fully) matching words into the second phrase, with a space between each phrase name.
paragraph-next
Example: If the first phrase contains b-i-b honeybees bees honey hives beehives b-i-e and the third phrase contains b-i-b bee b-i-e then the second phrase will contain b-i-b bees beehives b-i-e no-space .
-----

description-for-phrase-copy-words-that-contain-listed-words:
This action looks at all the words in the first phrase and identifies the words that contain text that match any of the words listed in the third phrase, and puts those partially (or fully) matching words into the second phrase, with a space between each phrase name.
paragraph-next
Example: If the first phrase contains b-i-b honeybees bees honey hives beehives b-i-e and the third phrase contains b-i-b bee hive b-i-e then the second phrase will contain b-i-b honeybees bees hives beehives b-i-e (but not b-i-b honey b-i-e ) no-space .
-----

description-for-phrase-copy-words-that-begin-with-listed-words:
This action looks at all the words in the first phrase and identifies the words that begin with text that match any of the words listed in the third phrase, and puts those partially (or fully) matching words into the second phrase, with a space between each phrase name.
paragraph-next
Example: If the first phrase contains b-i-b honeybees bees honey hives beehives b-i-e and the third phrase contains b-i-b bee hive b-i-e then the second phrase will contain b-i-b bees hives beehives b-i-e no-space .

-----

description-for-phrase-if-yes-begin:
This action looks at the first space hyphen-here delimited word, and if it is b-i-b yes b-i-e (or contains that word) then this action ignores all the text between the next occurrences of b-i-b am no-space bee if hyphen-here else am no-space enn b-i-e and b-i-b am no-space bee if hyphen-here end am no-space enn b-i-e (and ignores the b-i-b am no-space bee if hyphen-here else am no-space enn b-i-e and b-i-b am no-space bee if hyphen-here end am no-space enn b-i-e text items). sentence-next Otherwise (if the first word that follows does not contain b-i-b yes b-i-e no-space ) then this action ignores all the text between itself (the action name) and the next occurrence of b-i-b am no-space bee if hyphen-here else am no-space enn b-i-e (and ignores the b-i-b am no-space bee if hyphen-here else am no-space enn b-i-e and b-i-b am no-space bee if hyphen-here end am no-space enn b-i-e text items). sentence-next This action provides a major branching capability. sentence-next However, the action b-i-b if hyphen-here yes hyphen-here begin b-i-e and the text b-i-b am no-space bee if hyphen-here else am no-space enn b-i-e and the text b-i-b am no-space bee if hyphen-here end am no-space enn b-i-e b-b cannot b-e be nested (as allowed in most programming languages). sentence-next Specifically, an inner b-i-b if b-i-e action must not appear within an outer b-i-b if b-i-e action within the same Dashrep code. s-n The functional nesting of b-i-b if b-i-e branches is allowed if the inner b-i-b if b-i-e action appears within a separate phrase that is not expanded until after the outer b-i-b if b-i-e directive is handled.
-----

description-for-phrase-if-no-begin:
This action works similar to the action b-i-b if hyphen-here yes hyphen-here begin b-i-e except that the word b-i-b no b-i-e is used instead of the word b-i-b yes b-i-e no-space .
-----

description-for-phrase-if-else:
This special text is recognized by the action b-i-b if hyphen-here yes hyphen-here begin b-i-e and the action b-i-b if hyphen-here no hyphen-here begin b-i-e no-space . sentence-next It must be enclosed within b-i-b am no-space bee b-i-e and b-i-b am no-space enn b-i-e to be recognized.
-----

description-for-phrase-if-end:
This special text is recognized by the action b-i-b if hyphen-here yes hyphen-here begin b-i-e and the action b-i-b if hyphen-here no hyphen-here begin b-i-e no-space . sentence-next It must be enclosed within b-i-b am no-space bee b-i-e and b-i-b am no-space enn b-i-e to be recognized.

-----

description-for-phrase-use-handler-with-each-word-in-phrase:
This action expands the named handler (which is just a named phrase) multiple times, once for each word in the second phrase. s-n Each time the handler is expanded, the phrase b-i-b word h-h to h-h use h-h in h-h handler b-i-e contains the next word. s-n Nothing is supplied as a result. s-n Instead, the handler needs to store any changes in specified phrases (or in specified files). s-n The content in the second phrase must not change during the time this expansion is being done. s-n If the content in the second phrase begins or ends with a space, the leading and trailing spaces will be removed (even though this content is otherwise treated as a read h-h only list). s-n The first operand must be a phrase name that does not change, which means it cannot use any am no-space bee/am no-space enn words.
paragraph-next
Most commonly this action is used to either append multiple items of text to a single phrase, or generate multiple new phrases (which are typically named using the content of the phrase b-i-b word h-h to h-h use h-h in h-h handler b-i-e as part of the phrase name).
paragraph-next
Example: If the phrase b-i-b all h-h categories b-i-e contains b-i-b dolphin whale b-i-e and the phrase b-i-b handler h-h for h-h one h-h category b-i-e copies the contents of b-i-b word h-h to h-h use h-h in h-h handler b-i-e to b-i-b category h-h id b-i-e and expands a template that contains the phrase b-i-b category h-h id b-i-e then the code b-i-b use h-h handler h-h with h-h each h-h word h-h in h-h phrase handler h-h for h-h one h-h category all h-h categories b-i-e will generate two phrases, one in which the text b-i-b dolphin b-i-e is inserted at each instance of b-i-b category h-h id b-i-e and the second in which the text b-i-b whale b-i-e is inserted at each instance of b-i-b category h-h id b-i-e no-space .

This action reads from the specified file all the lines in that text file, and creates phrase definitions that are based on the first word in each line. s-n When the first word (of a line) matches the definition of the b-i-b dashrep h-h gather h-h tag h-h begin b-i-e phrase (which has a default value of b-i-b entry_begin b-i-e ), a new set of related items begins, and when the first word (of a line) matches the definition of the b-i-b dashrep h-h gather h-h tag h-h end b-i-e phrase (which has a default value of b-i-b entry_end b-i-e ), that set of items ends. s-n When the first word (of a line) matches the definition of the b-i-b dashrep h-h gather h-h tag h-h unique b-i-e phrase (which has a default value of b-i-b url b-i-e no-space , and which must appear within a set of items), the next (space h-h delimited) word in that line is used as the unique identifier for the items in that set. s-n If the same unique identifier appears in a later set, the items in the new set overwrite the previous items that have the same identifier. s-n Each generated phrase name begins with the tag name (that preceded that item) followed by the text b-i-b h-h value h-h for h-h unique h-h id h-h b-i-e and then followed by the unique value. s-n The list of encountered unique values is put into the second hyphen-here operand phrase. 
paragraph-next
If the text b-i-b multi_line_begin b-i-e immediately follows an item's name, the lines that follow, up to a line that contains (only) b-i-b multi_line_end b-i-e no-space , are combined (with a space between each line's content) into a long value for that named item.
paragraph-next
If a normal (non h-h multi) line begins with the definition of the b-i-b dashrep h-h gather h-h tag h-h delete b-i-e phrase (which has a default value of b-i-b delete_id b-i-e ) then the unique value in the second word (of that line) is omitted from the list of encountered unique values. s-n If a later entry specifies a definition for an entry that was requested to be deleted, the later entry overrides the deletion request. s-n A deletion request does not delete any of the already h-h defined phrases, but those phrases will not be accessed if the created phrases are only accessed using the list of encountered unique values. s-n As an example, an entry with the unique ID of b-i-b 1776 b-i-e can be deleted by appending (to the file) the line b-i-b delete_id 1776 b-i-e no-space .
paragraph-next
A list of the encountered tag names is put into the phrase b-i-b dashrep h-h gathered h-h tag h-h names b-i-e no-space . s-n The order of the list is the order in which the tag names were first encountered.
paragraph-next
This "gather" action is useful for accessing database h-h like text files where the first word in each line acts as the "field" name for a database record, and each set of items corresponds to one database record. s-n This action is also useful for spreadsheet h-h like information where the tag names are analogous to single h-h word column titles, and one row of spreadsheet data is stored in multiple lines, with each cell's content on a separate (labelled) line. s-n The order of the items within each set is not significant, and the order does not need to be the same from one set to another. s-n This action does not require that each set of items use the same first words that are used in other sets, but in that case the generated phrases should be checked for undefined (empty) phrase definitions. s-n location-of-read-file

description-for-phrase-gather-from-tagged-file-one-entry:
This action reads from a file that also can be read by the action b-i-b gather h-h tagged h-h info h-h from h-h file h-h and h-h put h-h unique h-h values h-h into h-h phrase b-i-e but only gets a single entry and puts that entry into the phrase that is named as the second operand. s-n The first operand is the name of the file. s-n The selected entry is specified by a value in the phrase b-i-b dashrep h-h gather h-h tag h-h matching h-h id b-i-e no-space . s-n If the text that is defined in the phrase b-i-b dashrep h-h gather h-h tag h-h delete b-i-e appears within the file and applies to the selected entry, then the content prior to that point is deleted, although later entries (after the last deletion) with the same matching value are recognized.

description-for-phrase-write-gathered-listed-items-to-end-of-file:
This action writes to the end of the specified file all or most of the information that was recently gathered using the action 
b-i-b gather h-h tagged h-h info h-h from h-h file b-i-e no-space . s-n
The first operand specifies a phrase that contains the list of unique values for the gathered items to be written,
which allows some of the items to be omitted. s-n
This action, unlike the "gather" action, does not support the use of multi-line entries. s-n
The second operand is the name of the target file. s-n
location-of-read-file s-n
This action uses the list of tag names in the phrase
b-i-b dashrep h-h gathered h-h tag h-h names h-h in h-h sequence b-i-e
to determine which tag names to use, and the sequence in which they are written.
----

description-for-phrase-expand-text:
This action expands ("translates") the contents of the first phrase and puts the results into the second phrase. s-n This action provides a way to separately expand the same phrase repeatedly, such as for generating multiple items that will appear in different table cells, and for expanding the same file h-h path template to point to different file paths. s-n If the name of the phrase that needs to be expanded can change, then the action b-i-b get h-h phrase h-h name h-h from h-h phrase b-i-e can be used. s-n If needed, the expanded result can be inserted inline (into the code that contains this action) by following this action with the expanded phrase name (without surrounding b-i-b am no-space bee b-i-e and b-i-b am no-space enn b-i-e delimiters). s-n The first phrase name and the second phrase name can be the same (without automatically causing an endless loop).
paragraph-next
In addition to replacing hyphenated phrase names with their associated definitions, the expansion also replaces each occurrence of a specially identified hyphenated phrase with the definition of that phrase. s-n The specially identified hyphenated phrases begin and end with angle brackets ( no-space b-i-b &lt; b-i-e and b-i-b &gt; b-i-e no-space ) and contain at least one underscore ( no-space b-i-b _ b-i-e no-space ), such as b-i-b &lt;special_content&gt; b-i-e no-space . s-n For each such specially identified hyphenated phrase, the underscores are (internally) replaced with hyphens, and if the resulting hyphenated phrase has a definition, then that definition is inserted in place of the specially identified hyphenated phrase (but the underscores are not changed if there is no associated phrase). s-n The special text b-i-b &lt;character_hyphen&gt; b-i-e is replaced by a hyphen ( no-space b-i-b - b-i-e no-space ) and is especially useful for handling text that contains hyphenated phrases that must not be replaced. s-n The special text items b-i-b &lt;no_space&gt; b-i-e and b-i-b &lt;new_line&gt; b-i-e provide functionality that is equivalent to the b-i-b no h-h space b-i-e and b-i-b new h-h line b-i-e directives.
paragraph-next
This action does the same translation of Dashrep text as the default expansion of Dashrep text, so this action is usually only needed when the same phrase must be expanded multiple times (with one or more different definitions each time).
----

description-for-phrase-get-phrase-name-from-phrase:
This action gets the phrase name that is in the definition of the operand, and supplies that phrase name as its result. s-n This action is useful when a phrase contains a phrase name and a different action needs to operate on the contained phrase, not the supplied phrase. s-n For example it is useful when using the action b-i-b expand h-h text b-i-e and the text to be expanded can change according to the phrase name contained in a phrase. s-n It is also useful with the action b-i-b trace h-h show b-i-e no-space .
paragraph-next
Example: s-n If the phrase b-i-b template h-h name b-i-e contains the text b-i-b animal h-h name b-i-e and b-i-b animal h-h name b-i-e contains the text b-i-b flipper b-i-e then the code b-i-b am no-space bee expand hyphen-here text am no-space bee get hyphen-here phrase hyphen-here name hyphen-here from hyphen-here phrase template hyphen-here name am no-space enn expanded hyphen-here text am no-space enn b-i-e then the phrase b-i-b expanded h-h text b-i-e will contain the text b-i-b flipper b-i-e no-space .
----

description-for-phrase-exit-from-dashrep:
This action first prints (to standard output) the contents of phrase b-i-b standard h-h output b-i-e and then immediately stops execution of a compiled Dashrep application (executable file). s-n If phrase b-i-b standard h-h output b-i-e is empty, nothing is printed. s-n This action is intended for unusual situations where normal exiting is not appropriate, such as reaching a hard limit. s-n This action can be used as a breakpoint when debugging Dashrep source code.
----

description-for-phrase-dashrep-endless-loop-counter-limit:
This phrase specifies the maximum number of replacements allowed during a Dashrep translation. s-n This number can be redefined, such as to a larger number. s-n If this limit is exceeded, Dashrep translation is stopped and an error message indicates which phrase was replaced the most number of times. s-n If large amounts of data are processed, the default number is not going to be large enough. s-n This limit interrupts endless loops, which can occur if a phrase is defined in a way that (either directly or indirectly) includes its own name.
----

description-for-phrase-no-space:
This directive removes any spaces (concatenation) after all other phrases have been replaced (during expansion). s-n If the b-i-b one h-h space b-i-e directive is adjacent, the b-i-b no h-h space b-i-e directive is ignored.
-----

description-for-phrase-one-space:
This directive inserts a single space. s-n If the b-i-b no h-h space b-i-e directive is adjacent, the b-i-b no h-h space b-i-e directive is ignored. sentence-next Repeating this directive does not insert multiple adjacent spaces, just a single space. sentence-next If multiple spaces are needed, a phrase such as b-i-b four hyphen-here spaces b-i-e can be defined as multiple spaces, and then those spaces will be inserted where the text b-i-b <four_spaces> b-i-e appears.
-----

description-for-phrase-non-breaking-space:
This directive inserts a non h-h breaking space where it is encountered within text that is expanded. s-n
This text is inserted even if the b-i-b no hyphen-here space b-i-e directive is adjacent. s-n The default value that is inserted, which is intended for use in HTML, is b-i-b &amp; no-space nbsp; b-i-e no-space .
-----

description-for-phrase-new-line:
This directive inserts a
b-i-b newline b-i-e
character, which specifies the start of a new line.
s-n
If the target language, such as HTML, ignores line breaks, the line break will not be visible in the displayed result.
-----

description-for-phrase-empty-line:
This directive specifies an empty line, which is equivalent to two adjacent
b-i-b new h-h line b-i-e
directives.
-----

description-for-phrase-line-break:
This phrase is pre h-h defined as
b-i-b no h-h space &lt;br&nbsp;/&gt; no h-h space b-i-e
no-space , which specifies a line break in the HTML language.
s-n
This definition can be changed, which is useful if the target language is not HTML.
-----

description-for-phrase-empty-text:
This pre h-h defined phrase contains no text. s-n
This phrase is seldom needed. s-n
To clear a phrase, use the action b-i-b clear h-h phrase b-i-e no-space . s-n To test whether a phrase's definition is empty, use the action
b-i-b yes h-h or h-h no h-h empty h-h phrase b-i-e
no-space .
-----

description-for-phrase-append-text:
This action copies the definition of the first hyphenated phrase onto the end of the definition of the second hyphenated phrase. s-n
This action must be followed by two phrase names, not one. s-n 
Among other uses, this action can be used to build a list of items, or to insert text (such as a raw Dashrep definition) within other text without being translated.
-----

description-for-phrase-append-repeatedly-using-count:
This action repeatedly appends the definition of the first hyphenated phrase to the end of the definition of the second hyphenated phrase, until the number of copies specified in the third operand have been inserted. s-n
Spaces separate the appended text items. s-n
This action must be followed by two phrase names and a positive integer number. s-n 
This action avoids complications that can arise if the text being copied should not be expanded, and is much faster than using the b-i-b use h-h handler h-h with h-h each h-h word h-h in h-h phrase b-i-e no-space .
-----

description-for-phrase-append-multiple-from-phrases-named-in-pattern:
This action appends multiple phrase definitions onto the end of the definition of the second phrase. s-n The pattern for the multiple phrase names is specified in the first phrase. s-n The pattern must contain characters between the text b-i-b am no-space bee hyphen-here no-space b-i-e and the text b-i-b no-space hyphen-here am no-space enn b-i-e no-space , and these characters must be the name of a phrase that contains the space hyphen-here delimited words that will be inserted at that position within the pattern. s-n (Although b-i-b fenam no-space bee b-i-e or b-i-b am no-space ennfen b-i-e might normally be used to indicate the inclusion of a hyphen, they are not recognized by this action.) s-n If the phrase that contains the word list contains only a single word without any spaces, then only one item will be appended. s-n If the list is empty, nothing will be appended. s-n This action is useful for building a long list fast, without needing to use a separate Dashrep action for each item appended.
paragraph-next
Example: s-n If the first phrase contains the text b-i-b item h-h am no-space bee h-h list h-h of h-h numbers h-h as h-h text h-h am no-space enn b-i-e and the phrase b-i-b list h-h of h-h numbers h-h as h-h text b-i-e contains the text b-i-b one two three b-i-e and the second phrase already contains the text b-i-b dolphin b-i-e and the phrase b-i-b item h-h one b-i-e contains b-i-b buffalo b-i-e and the phrase b-i-b item h-h two b-i-e contains b-i-b bear b-i-e and the phrase b-i-b item h-h three b-i-e contains b-i-b eagle b-i-e then the second phrase will contain b-i-b dolphin buffalo bear eagle b-i-e no-space .
-----

description-for-phrase-copy-listed-words-to-phrases-named-in-pattern:
This action copies multiple phrase definitions. s-n Specifically space h-h delimited words in the first phrase are copied to multiple phrase names, where the phrase names have the pattern specified in the second phrase. s-n The pattern must contain characters between the text b-i-b am no-space bee hyphen-here no-space b-i-e (or b-i-b fenam no-space bee hyphen-here no-space b-i-e no-space ) and the text b-i-b no-space hyphen-here am no-space enn b-i-e (or b-i-b am no-space ennfen hyphen-here no-space b-i-e no-space ) no-space , and these characters must be the name of a phrase that contains the space hyphen-here delimited words that will be inserted at that position within the pattern. s-n If the phrase that contains the target word list contains only a single word without any spaces, then only one item will be copied. s-n If the list is empty, nothing will be copied. s-n If the number of words in the first phrase is different from the number of words in the list that is specified within the pattern, the copying will stop when the shorter list is exhausted. s-n This action is useful for copying a long list fast, without needing to use a separate Dashrep action for each item copied.
paragraph-next
Example: If the first phrase contains b-i-b dolphin buffalo bear b-i-e no-space , and the second phrase contains b-i-b item h-h am no-space bee h-h list h-h of h-h numbers h-h as h-h text h-h am no-space enn b-i-e no-space , and the phrase b-i-b list h-h of h-h numbers h-h as h-h text b-i-e contains the text b-i-b one two three b-i-e no-space , then the phrase b-i-b item h-h one b-i-e will contain b-i-b dolphin b-i-e and the phrase b-i-b item h-h two b-i-e will contain b-i-b buffalo b-i-e and the phrase b-i-b item h-h three b-i-e will contain b-i-b bear b-i-e no-space .
-----

description-for-phrase-zero-one-multiple:
This action supplies either b-i-b zero b-i-e or b-i-b one b-i-e or b-i-b multiple b-i-e depending upon whether the following integer number equals zero, one, or multiple (more than one). s-n This phrase is very useful for choosing between singular and plural forms of words based on a data-supplied count.
-----

description-for-phrase-yes-if-all-yes:
This action supplies b-i-b yes b-i-e if the following text contains the text b-i-b yes b-i-e or any number of b-i-b yes b-i-e words (either with or without separating spaces) and no other (non hyphen-here space) characters, and supplies b-i-b no b-i-e otherwise. s-n This action is similar to the logic AND operator in other languages. s-n If there are no operands, this action supplies b-i-b no b-i-e no-space .
----

description-for-phrase-yes-if-any-yes:
This action supplies b-i-b yes b-i-e if the following text contains the text b-i-b yes b-i-e no-space , and supplies b-i-b no b-i-e otherwise. s-n This action is similar to the logic OR operator in other languages. s-n If there are no operands, this action supplies b-i-b no b-i-e no-space .
----

description-for-phrase-yes-if-not-no:
This action supplies b-i-b no b-i-e if the following word (space h-h delimited characters) is b-i-b no b-i-e no-space , and supplies b-i-b yes b-i-e otherwise. s-n This action is useful if the word can be something other than b-i-b yes b-i-e or b-i-b no b-i-e no-space , but only b-i-b no b-i-e is significant. s-n If there are no operands, this action supplies b-i-b yes b-i-e no-space .
----

description-for-phrase-no-if-not-yes:
This action supplies b-i-b yes b-i-e if the following word (space h-h delimited characters) is b-i-b yes b-i-e no-space , and supplies b-i-b no b-i-e otherwise. s-n This action is useful if the word can be something other than b-i-b yes b-i-e or b-i-b no b-i-e no-space , but only b-i-b yes b-i-e is significant. s-n If there are no operands, this action supplies b-i-b no b-i-e no-space .
----

description-for-phrase-no-if-any-no:
This action supplies b-i-b no b-i-e if the following text contains the text b-i-b no b-i-e no-space , and supplies b-i-b yes b-i-e otherwise. s-n If there are no operands, this action supplies b-i-b yes b-i-e no-space .
----

description-for-phrase-numeric-odd-or-even:
This action supplies the word b-i-b odd b-i-e or b-i-b even b-i-e based on whether the value of the following operand is an odd or even integer. s-n It is useful for handling row (or column) numbers in a table. s-n The result is unpredictable if the operand is not a positive integer.
-----

description-for-phrase-dashrep-path-prefix-for-file-reading:
This phrase specifies a different (non-local-folder) path for file read operations. s-n If this definition is empty (which is the default value), the local directory is used. s-n If a path prefix is included with any of the file-reading actions, that path is ignored and this path is used instead. s-n This approach limits the chances of intentional or accidental access to files that should not be accessed. s-n A different path is used for file-writing actions.
-----

description-for-phrase-dashrep-path-prefix-for-file-writing:
This phrase specifies a different (non-local-folder) path for file write operations. s-n If this definition is empty (which is the default value), the local directory is used. s-n If a path prefix is included with any of the file-writing actions, that path is ignored and this path is used instead. s-n This approach limits the chances of intentional or accidental access to files that should not be accessed. s-n A different path is used for file-reading actions.
-----

description-for-phrase-get-definitions-from-phrase:
This action reads Dashrep definitions from the specified phrase and creates the named phrases with their associated definitions.
s-n
An optional colon can appear at the end of each defined phrase name.
s-n
This action overwrites any existing phrase definitions that have the same phrase names.
paragraph-next
Very importantly, the first phrase either must be generated or copied from a file because the phrase must contain the (space h-h delimited) word
b-i-b def no-space enn b-i-e
at the end of each definition, but that word cannot appear within a definition that is supplied to the compiler as source code.
s-n
A useful trick is to terminate each definition with a placeholder word such as
b-i-b delayed_defenn b-i-e no-space , and that placeholder word can be replaced with the word
b-i-b def no-space enn b-i-e
before this action is used.
paragraph-next
Example: If the first phrase is b-i-b supplied h-h definitions b-i-e and it contains b-i-b
animal h-h type: dolphin def no-space enn
animal h-h name: first flipper def no-space enn
b-i-e
then this action will create a phrase named
b-i-b animal h-h type b-i-e
that is defined as
b-i-b dolphin b-i-e
and another phrase named
b-i-b animal h-h name b-i-e
that is defined as
b-i-b first flipper b-i-e
no-space .
-----

description-for-phrase-put-listed-phrase-definitions-into-phrase:
This action puts into the second phrase the phrase names and their associated Dashrep definitions that are listed in the first phrase.
s-n
Each definition begins with the phrase name with an appended colon.
s-n
Each definition is terminated with the word
b-i-b def no-space enn b-i-e
followed by a newline character.
s-n
This format is compatible with the format used by the action
b-i-b get-definitions-from-phrase b-i-e
because that action handles newline characters the same as spaces,
and it ignores the colon at the end of a phrase name.
paragraph-next
Example: If the first phrase is
b-i-b list h-h of h-h phrases h-h from h-h which h-h to h-h get h-h definitions b-i-e
and it contains b-i-b animal h-h type animal h-h name b-i-e
and the phrase
b-i-b animal h-h type b-i-e
contains
b-i-b dolphin b-i-e
and the phrase
b-i-b animal h-h name b-i-e
contains
b-i-b first flipper b-i-e
then this action creates a phrase that contains:
line-break
b-i-b
animal h-h type: dolphin def no-space enn
line-break
animal h-h name: first flipper def no-space enn
b-i-e

s-n
The first operand is the old filename, and the second operand is the new filename.
s-n
The location of the file is specified by the phrase 
name-of-phrase-that-specifies-write-directory
no-space .
s-n
This action is useful for coordinating parallel tasks by renaming the data file that the current task will be handling,
which prevents other parallel tasks from handling the same data.

www.example.org/cgi-bin/value%1Fone=123&value%2Dtwo=abc+def
b-i-e
then the new phrase
b-i-b input-value_one b-i-e will contain the text b-i-b 123 b-i-e
and
b-i-b input-value-two b-i-e will contain the text b-i-b abc def b-i-e
and
b-i-b input-raw-cgi-string b-i-e will contain the text b-i-b value%1Fone=123&value%2Dtwo=abc+def b-i-e
no-space . s-n
As indicated by this example, the CGI conversion converts
b-i-b %1F b-i-e into b-i-b _ b-i-e (underscore)
and converts
b-i-b %20 b-i-e into a hyphen
and converts
b-i-b + b-i-e into a space
no-space .

description-for-phrase-put-into-phrase:
This action copies into the first hyphenated phrase the text that follows the first hyphenated phrase, up to the next (innermost) b-i-b am no-space enn b-i-e no-space . s-n The text can contain hyphens if they are not adjacent to an open angle bracket or close angle bracket. s-n Trailing spaces and trailing hyphens are ignored.
paragraph-next
Example: After expanding the code b-i-b am no-space bee put-into-phrase target-phrase whale dolphin starfish am no-space enn b-i-e the phrase b-i-b target h-h phrase b-i-e
will contain b-i-b whale dolphin starfish b-i-e no-space .
-----

description-for-phrase-append-text:
This action appends the definition of the first phrase to the end of the definition of the second phrase, and inserts a single space between the existing text and the appended text. s-n The two phrase names can be the same. s-n If the target phrase is initially empty, the space is not inserted.
----

description-for-phrase-append-text-no-space:
This action appends the definition of the first phrase to the end of the definition of the second phrase, without inserting a separating space, and without removing any adjacent trailing spaces (in the second phrase definition) or leading spaces (in the first phrase definition). s-n The two phrase names can be the same.
----

description-for-phrase-append-new-line:
This action appends a newline code to the end of a definition.
----

description-for-phrase-copy-word-at-position:
This action copies one word from the definition of the first phrase into the definition of the second phrase, with the word position being specified by a number. s-n A position number of 1 indicates the first word in the definition. s-n The words are any sequence of characters that does not include a space, and spaces are regarded as the separation between each pair of words. s-n If the position number exceeds the word count, the last word is copied.
----

description-for-phrase-copy-zero-pad-left-to-length:
This action copies text from the definition of the first phrase into the definition of the second phrase and inserts zeros ( no-space b-i-b 0 b-i-e no-space ) to the left of the copied characters. s-n The resulting padded text has the length specified by the number in the third operand. s-n Normally this action is used with numbers, but the action does not check whether the copied text is a number.
----

description-for-phrase-copy-and-replace-using-paired-listed-words:
This action copies the definition of the first phrase into the definition of the second phrase, but replaces some text strings with associated text strings, using paired words in the third operand. s-n The paired words in the third operand are delimited by spaces, and the first word in each pair specifies what text to find, and the second word in each pair specifies the replacement text for that found word.
paragraph-next
Example: To replace named HTML entities and some special characters with their unicode equivalent entities, the third phrase can contain text such as the following: b-i-b
&#38;amp; &#38;#38; &#38;lt; &#38;#60; < &#38;#60 &#38;gt; &#38;#62; > &#38;#62; &#38;ldquo; &#38;#8220; &#38;rdquo; &#38;#8221; &#38;lsquo; &#38;#8216; &#38;rsquo; &#38;#8217; &#38;quot; &#38;#34; " &#38;#34; &#38;apos; &#38;#39; ' &#38;#39; &#38;nbsp; &#38;#160;
b-i-e
paragraph-next
Another example: To identify a numeric pattern by converting all digits into the digit nine, the third phrase can contain the following text:
b-i-b 0 9 1 9 2 9 3 9 4 9 5 9 6 9 7 9 8 9 b-i-e s-n
paragraph-next
As these examples illustrate, the words can include single characters. s-n Obviously none of the words in the third phrase can contain a space. s-n If any searched words or any inserted words contain text that matches other searched words, the result becomes unpredictable. s-n The first two phrase names can be the same.
----

description-for-phrase-convert-unicode-to-html-entities
This action copies all the text from the first phrase into the second phrase but converts non-ASCII characters into HTML entities. s-n The HTML entities use decimal numbers, which means that open double quotation marks become & no-space # no-space 8220 no-space ; and & no-space # no-space 8221 no-space ;.
----

description-for-phrase-dashrep-language-yes:

r-b th-b Word th-n Description th-e r-e

r-b c-b com no-space bee c-n Indicates the beginning of a comment. line-break line-break For example, b-i-b com no-space bee **** This is a comment **** com no-space enn b-i-e is a comment that is ignored if it appears within Dashrep source code. line-break line-break When spoken, the accent is on the characters b-i-b com b-i-e no-space . c-e r-e

r-b c-b com no-space enn c-n Indicates the end of a comment. s-n For details, see b-i-b com no-space bee b-i-e no-space . line-break line-break When spoken, the accent is on the characters b-i-b enn b-i-e no-space . c-e r-e

r-b c-b am no-space bee c-n Indicates the beginning of an action h-h or h-h replacement clause. s-n How the clause is handled depends on what the clause contains. line-break line-break If the word that immediately follows am no-space bee is an action name, the requested action is done. line-break line-break If (after any inner clauses have been expanded) the word that immediately follows am no-space bee is not an action name, and if the word is a phrase name that has a current definition that does not include am no-space bee and am no-space enn, and if that phrase name is immediately followed by am no-space enn, then the current definition of that phrase is inserted into the text being generated. line-break line-break If (after any inner clauses have been expanded) the word that immediately follows am no-space bee is not an action name, and if that word is immediately followed by am no-space enn, and if the contained phrase name has a definition that contains am no-space bee and am no-space enn (or equivalents), then that executable phrase definition is expanded, and any optionally generated text is inserted into where the clause occurs. line-break line-break For example, b-i-b am no-space bee numeric h-h increment dolphin h-h count am no-space enn b-i-e would increment the number within the phrase b-i-b dolphin h-h count b-i-e each time it is encountered during execution. line-break line-break As a different kind of example, b-i-b am no-space bee dolphin h-h count am no-space enn b-i-e would insert the current definition of the phrase b-i-b dolphin h-h count b-i-e no-space . line-break line-break As yet another kind of example, if a phrase being expanded contains b-i-b am no-space bee count h-h another h-h dolphin am no-space enn b-i-e no-space , and the phrase b-i-b count h-h another h-h dolphin b-i-e has a definition that contains am no-space bee and am no-space enn no-space , then the executable Dashrep code within the phrase b-i-b count h-h another h-h dolphin b-i-e would be executed. line-break line-break When spoken, the accent is on the characters b-i-b am b-i-e no-space . c-e r-e

r-b c-b am no-space enn c-n Indicates the end of an action h-h or h-h replacement clause. s-n For details, see b-i-b am no-space bee b-i-e no-space . line-break line-break When spoken, the accent is on the characters b-i-b enn b-i-e no-space . c-e r-e

r-b c-b def no-space enn c-n Indicates the end of a phrase definition. s-n The beginning of the definition follows the word being defined. s-n The first space hyphen-here delimited word after the word b-i-b def no-space enn b-i-e is the next hyphenated phrase name to be defined. line-break line-break The beginning of the Dashrep code supplied to the Dashrep compiler is assumed to be the first hyphenated phrase name followed by its definition, and followed by the word b-i-b def no-space enn b-i-e no-space . s-n If the supplied Dashrep code does not contain any occurrence of the word b-i-b def no-space enn b-i-e no-space , then the entire Dashrep code is treated as a sequence of text that only has replacements when the hyphenated phrases are the ones defined within the Dashrep language. line-break line-break Typically, as explained below, four adjacent hyphens ( h-h h-h h-h h-h ), typically on a separate line, are used instead of the word def no-space enn because they are easier to see within Dashrep code. line-break line-break When spoken, the accent is on the characters b-i-b enn b-i-e no-space . c-e r-e

r-b c-b fenam no-space bee c-n Indicates the continuation of a hyphenated phrase that includes an action h-h or h-h replacement clause as part of the phrase name. line-break line-break For example, b-i-b info h-h for h-h dolphin h-h named b-i-e red-b fenam no-space bee red-e b-i-b dolphin h-h name am no-space enn b-i-e becomes b-i-b info h-h for h-h dolphin h-h named h-h leaper b-i-e if b-i-b dolphin h-h name b-i-e equals b-i-b leaper b-i-e no-space . line-break line-break When spoken, the accent is on the characters b-i-b am b-i-e no-space . c-e r-e

r-b c-b am no-space ennfen c-n Indicates the end of an action h-h or h-h replacement clause that, when it is translated, becomes part of a phrase name. line-break line-break For example, b-i-b info h-h in h-h row fenam no-space bee row h-h number b-i-e red-b am no-space ennfen red-e b-i-b column fenam no-space bee column h-h number am no-space enn b-i-e becomes b-i-b info h-h in h-h row h-h 2 h-h column h-h 3 b-i-e if b-i-b row h-h number b-i-e equals b-i-b 2 b-i-e and b-i-b column h-h number b-i-e equals b-i-b 3 b-i-e no-space . line-break line-break When spoken, the accent is on the characters b-i-b am b-i-e no-space . c-e r-e

r-b c-b am no-space enn no-space fenam no-space bee c-n Indicates the continuation of a phrase name that includes two adjacent action h-h or h-h replacement clauses as part of the phrase name. line-break line-break For example, b-i-b info h-h at h-h row h-h and h-h column fenam no-space bee row h-h number b-i-e red-b am no-space enn no-space fenam no-space bee red-e b-i-b column h-h number am no-space enn b-i-e becomes b-i-b info h-h at h-h row h-h and h-h column h-h 2 h-h 3 b-i-e if b-i-b row h-h number b-i-e equals b-i-b 2 b-i-e and b-i-b column h-h number b-i-e equals b-i-b 3 b-i-e no-space . line-break line-break When spoken, the accent is on the characters b-i-b am b-i-e em-dash in both places. c-e r-e

r-b c-b no no-space spay c-n This word is rarely needed. s-n It indicates that there should be no space to the right when it appears immediately before b-i-b am no-space bee b-i-e and no space to the left when it appears immediately after b-i-b am no-space enn b-i-e no-space . s-n This word has no special meaning when it is not adjacent to either of these other words. s-n For other places where spaces should be removed, the phrase b-i-b no h-h space b-i-e should be used instead. line-break line-break For example, b-i-b info h-h at h-h row h-h and h-h column fenam no-space bee row h-h number am no-space enn b-i-b red-b no no-space spay red-e b-i-e am no-space bee column h-h number am no-space enn b-i-e becomes b-i-b info h-h at h-h row h-h and h-h column h-h 002003 b-i-e if b-i-b row h-h number b-i-e equals b-i-b 002 b-i-e and b-i-b column h-h number b-i-e equals b-i-b 003 b-i-e no-space . line-break line-break When spoken, the accent is on the characters b-i-b no b-i-e no-space . c-e r-e

r-b c-b 3 c-n Comment c-n b-i-b com no-space bee b-i-e non-breaking-space comment here non-breaking-space b-i-b com no-space enn b-i-e c-n Comments are ignored. s-n The word b-i-b com no-space bee b-i-e indicates the beginning of a comment, and the word b-i-b com no-space enn b-i-e indicates the end of the comment. s-n Comments cannot be nested; if they are, the results are unpredictable. c-e r-e

r-b c-b 4 c-n Hyphen c-n hyphen-here c-n A hyphen joins words that together form a hyphenated phrase. s-n For example, b-i-b dolphin h-h name b-i-e and b-i-b animals h-h under h-h the h-h sea b-i-e are hyphenated phrases. line-break line-break A hyphen and a dash are different names for the same symbol. line-break line-break A hyphenated phrase can contain multiple adjacent hyphens. s-n This convention can be used to avoid ambiguity in a &ldquo;namespace&rdquo;, and can be useful in ways that are similar to situations where object hyphen-here oriented languages would use a double colon (::). s-n For example, b-i-b animal h-h name h-h h-h characteristic b-i-e is a valid hyphenated phrase name. line-break line-break A hyphenated phrase cannot begin or end with a hyphen. c-e r-e

r-b c-b 5 c-n Three or more adjacent hyphens c-n b-i-b h-h h-h h-h h-h b-i-e c-n Indicates the end of a phrase definition in Dashrep source code supplied to the Dashrep compiler. s-n This text is equivalent to the b-i-b def no-space enn b-i-e word. s-n The adjacent hyphens are easier to see (compared to the word b-i-b def no-space enn b-i-e no-space ) when Dashrep code is viewed in a text editor. c-e r-e

r-b c-b 6 c-n Action c-n b-i-b am no-space bee b-i-e zero h-h one h-h multiple 3 b-i-b am no-space enn b-i-e c-n If the first (left-most) hyphenated phrase following the word b-i-b am no-space bee b-i-e (or equivalent) is a recognized action (see below), and the action is followed by text that the action knows how to handle, and the word b-i-b am no-space enn b-i-e terminates the action h-h or h-h replacement clause, then the action is performed. s-n Some actions produce text that become a replacement for the action h-h or h-h replacement clause. s-n Other actions operate on specified phrases or files and do not produce any text, in which case a space is supplied as the result that is inserted to replace the action phrase.

In general, the word b-i-b am no-space bee b-i-e indicates the beginning of an action h-h or h-h replacement clause, and the word b-i-b am no-space enn b-i-e indicates the end of an action h-h or h-h replacement clause. s-n An inner action h-h or h-h replacement clause is expanded before the surrounding text is expanded. s-n When an action h-h or h-h replacement clause contains a nested action h-h or h-h replacement clause (up to any level of nesting), the first-encountered innermost action h-h or h-h replacement clause is expanded first. s-n After an action h-h or h-h replacement clause is expanded, any spaces at the beginning or end of the supplied result are removed, which allows the expanded text to become part of a hyphenated phrase, which enables versatile functionality.
c-e r-e

r-b c-b 6 c-n Phrase name within action h-h or h-h replacement clause c-n b-i-b am no-space bee b-i-e user h-h phrase h-h name b-i-b am no-space enn b-i-e c-n A hyphenated phrase within the words b-i-b am no-space bee b-i-e and b-i-b am no-space enn b-i-e is expanded in h-h place using the phrase's definition as the result. s-n The phrase definition can, in turn, contain action h-h or h-h replacement clauses, and they also will be expanded. s-n If the phrase name is not defined, it is left as-is, and the surrounding parameter words ( no-space b-i-b am no-space bee b-i-e and b-i-b am no-space enn b-i-e no-space ) are removed. s-n Spaces at the beginning and end of the action h-h or h-h replacement clause are also removed, which allows the expanded text to become part of a hyphenated phrase, which enables versatile functionality. s-n The expansion of subordinate hyphenated phrases stops when there are no surrounding parameter words ( no-space b-i-b am no-space bee b-i-e and b-i-b am no-space enn b-i-e no-space ), even if that un hyphen-here surrounded hyphenated phrase contains (in its definition) the words b-i-b am no-space bee b-i-e and b-i-b am no-space enn b-i-e no-space . s-n The expansion of subordinate hyphenated phrases also stops if a definition contains use of the words b-i-b am no-space bee b-i-e and b-i-b am no-space enn b-i-e without correct pairing.

The same general comments about action phrases (see above) also apply to a phrase name within an action h-h or h-h replacement clause.

r-b c-b 7 c-n Hyphenated phrase c-n dolphin h-h name c-n A hyphen surrounded by non-space characters is recognized as a hyphenated phrase. s-n A phrase name is case-sensitive. s-n Lowercase-only names are recommended, but not required. s-n Speakable names are recommended, but not required. s-n The use of nouns before, rather than after, adjectives is recommended; this convention (for example b-i-b rectangle h-h large h-h begin b-i-e instead of b-i-b large h-h rectangle h-h begin b-i-e no-space ) is typical of many spoken languages, but not English.  s-n The first character cannot be a hyphen and cannot be a digit. s-n The last character cannot be a hyphen. c-e r-e

r-b c-b 7 c-n Undefined hyphenated phrase c-n quite-talkative dolphin c-n If a hyphenated phrase has not been defined, it is not translated; it remains unchanged. s-n If a hyphenated phrase has been defined and is now empty, the hyphenated phrase will disapper. c-e r-e

r-b c-b 8 c-n Colon c-n dolphin h-h name no-space b-i-b : b-i-e leaper non-breaking-space b-i-b h-h h-h h-h h-h b-i-e c-n A colon can appear at the end of a hyphenated phrase being defined. s-n This convention is optional. s-n It offers the advantage of making it easier to search for where a hyphenated phrase is defined, without also finding each place it is used. c-e r-e

r-b c-b 9 c-n New line or line break c-n one line b-i-b line-break b-i-e next line c-n When a new line begins, it is replaced with a space. s-n When a new line needs to be inserted into the resulting text, the b-i-b new h-h line b-i-e phrase (explained below) can be used. s-n If a line break in the target language (such as HTML) is needed, the phrase b-i-b line h-h break b-i-e can be used to insert the appropriate target-specific code (which in HTML is the b-i-b &lt;br \&gt; b-i-e tag). s-n Newline characters can be inserted into text using special actions (explained below) and by using the special phrase b-i-b character hyphen-here newline b-i-e as an operand with some actions. c-e r-e

r-b c-b 10 c-n hyphen h-h here c-n b-i-b hyphen h-h here b-i-e c-n Explained below. c-e r-e

r-b c-b 10 c-n non h-h breaking h-h space c-n b-i-b non h-h breaking h-h space b-i-e c-n Explained below. c-e r-e

r-b c-b 10 c-n new h-h line c-n b-i-b new h-h line b-i-e c-n Explained below. c-e r-e

r-b c-b 10 c-n no h-h space c-n b-i-b no h-h space b-i-e c-n Explained below. c-e r-e

r-b c-b 10 c-n one h-h space c-n b-i-b one h-h space b-i-e c-n Explained below. c-e r-e
