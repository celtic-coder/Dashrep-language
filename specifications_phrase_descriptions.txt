description-for-phrase-yes-or-no-allow-user-defined-actions:
If this phrase is b-i-b yes b-i-e then a user h-h defined phrase can be used as an action. s-n Otherwise a user h-h defined action will not be recognized. s-n When a user h-h defined action is encountered, the first four space h-h delimited words that follow the (hyphenated) action name become available as the definitions of the phrases
b-i-b user h-h defined h-h action h-h operand h-h one b-i-e no-space ,
b-i-b user h-h defined h-h action h-h operand h-h two b-i-e no-space ,
b-i-b user h-h defined h-h action h-h operand h-h three b-i-e no-space ,
and
b-i-b user h-h defined h-h action h-h operand h-h four b-i-e no-space . s-n
If user h-h defined actions are allowed, the actions do not need to be defined in any special way. s-n A user h-h defined action is simply a hyphenated phrase that can immediately follow an opening parameter bracket ( no-space b-i-b [ no-space h-h b-i-e no-space ) and the hyphenated phrase can use the special operand phrase names to access the words that follow the user h-h defined action phrase (up to the closing parameter bracket ( b-i-b h-h no-space ] b-i-e no-space ) no-space .

description-for-phrase-dashrep-definition-append-next:
This directive requests that the next definition be appended to the existing definition of the specified phrase. s-n This directive allows a list to be created during the reading of definitions because it overrides the normal convention of replacing the existing definition (when the same phrase name is defined more than once).
-----

description-for-phrase-delayed-nospace:
This phrase is not defined, but this name is reserved for use as a placeholder where the phrase b-i-b no h-h space b-i-e needs to be inserted later, after other replacements have been done. s-n When ready, this phrase should be defined as b-i-b no h-h space b-i-e just before the final translation step.
-----

description-for-phrase-delayed-newline:
This phrase is not defined, but this name is reserved for use as a placeholder where the phrase b-i-b new h-h line b-i-e needs to be inserted later, after other replacements have been done. s-n When ready, this phrase should be defined as b-i-b new h-h line b-i-e just before the final translation step.

no-space .
-----

description-for-phrase-character-tab:
A phrase that contains a tab character. s-n
In some other programming languages this character is represented by the string

no-space .
-----

description-for-phrase-characters-in-phrase-get-from-position-to-position:
An action that gets the characters from the specified phrase starting at the position indicated by the first number, and ending at the position indicated by the second number. s-n The character positions are numbered starting at 1 in the first character position. s-n If the second number is greater than the number of characters, then the entire remainder of the phrase is retrieved (which means that using a large second number such as 9999 eliminates needing to know how many characters are in the phrase).
-----

description-for-phrase-clear-all-expanded-text-up-to-here:
An action that removes all the expanded text up to this action. s-n It is useful when earlier actions might have failed to recognize some phrase names and left those phrase names in the text being expanded.
-----

description-for-phrase-copy-from-phrase-to-phrase-and-alphabetic-sort-by-word:
An action that gets the space hyphen-here delimited words in the first phrase, and sorts those words alphabetically, and puts those sorted words into the second phrase. s-n The two phrase names can be the same.
-----

description-for-phrase-copy-from-phrase-to-phrase-and-encode-as-cgi-parameter:
An action that converts symbols and other non hyphen-here alphabetic and non hyphen-here digit characters into the special format that allows the string to be passed to a web server as a CGI parameter. s-n As an example, a comma is represented as b-b %2c b-e no-space . s-n The two phrase names can be the same.
-----

description-for-phrase-copy-from-phrase-to-phrase-and-decode-from-cgi-parameter:
An action that converts a CGI parameter into normal (non h-h encoded) characters. sentence-next This action is the inverse of the b-i-b copy h-h from h-h phrase h-h to h-h phrase h-h and h-h encode h-h as h-h cgi h-h parameter b-i-e action. s-n As an example, the string b-b %2c b-e is converted into a space character. s-n The two phrase names can be the same.
-----

description-for-phrase-copy-from-phrase-to-phrase-and-remove-extra-spaces:
An action that removes multiple adjacent spaces so that only single spaces occur, and removes all spaces at the beginning and end of the text. s-n The first phrase specifies the source text, and the second phrase specifies the destination. s-n The two phrase names can be the same.

description-for-phrase-copy-from-phrase-to-phrase-and-replace-string-in-phrase-with-phrase:
An action that replaces each occurrence of the third phrase with the text in the fourth phrase, based on the text in the first phrase, and places the result into the second phrase. s-n If the replacement phrase contains the search phrase, nothing is changed, and a warning is put into the trace information because that could cause an endless loop. s-n The special phrases b-i-b character hyphen-here space b-i-e and b-i-b character hyphen-here hyphen b-i-e and b-i-b character hyphen-here newline b-i-e are useful here (because the language does not have ways to define those characters). s-n The two phrase names can be the same.
-----

description-for-phrase-copy-from-phrase-to-phrase-and-replace-characters-in-string-with-characters-in-string:
An action that replaces some (or all or no) characters in the first phrase if the character appears in the third phrase, where the replacement character is in the fourth phrase at the same sequence position, and the result is put into the second phrase. s-n For example, if the first and second phrase names are the same, and that phrase contains the characters b-i-b abcdefghijklm b-i-e no-space , and the third phrase contains the characters b-i-b aeiou b-i-e no-space , and the fourth phrase contains b-i-b 12345 b-i-e no-space , then the result (in the named phrase) will be b-i-b 1bcd2fgh3jklm b-i-e no-space . s-n If there are fewer replacement characters than characters to match, then the characters at the end of the third phrase will be removed, instead of being replaced. s-n As another example, if the digits zero (0) through eight (8) are replaced by the digit nine (9), the result can be checked to see if it matches a recognizable or acceptable pattern.
-----

description-for-phrase-copy-from-phrase-to-phrase-characters-from-position-to-position:
An action that copies specified characters from the first phrase to the second phrase. s-n The third and fourth operands indicate the starting and ending character positions, with the first character position being numbered one (1). s-n The starting character position must not be larger than the ending character position. s-n The two phrase names can be the same.
-----

description-for-phrase-copy-from-phrase-to-phrase-but-remove-first-word:
An action that copies the text in the first phrase into the second phrase but omits the first space hyphen-here delimited word. s-n The two phrase names can be the same.
-----

description-for-phrase-copy-from-phrase-to-phrase-but-remove-last-word:
An action that copies the text in the first phrase into the second phrase but omits the last space hyphen-here delimited word. s-n The two phrase names can be the same.
-----

description-for-phrase-copy-from-phrase-to-phrase-lowercase-only:
An action that copies the definition of the first phrase into the definition of the second phrase, but changes any uppercase characters (such as b-i-b A b-i-e and b-i-b B b-i-e no-space ) into lowercase characters (such as b-i-b a b-i-e and b-i-b b b-i-e no-space ). s-n The two phrase names can be the same.
----

description-for-phrase-copy-from-phrase-to-phrase-uppercase-only:
An action that copies the definition of the first phrase into the definition of the second phrase, but changes any lowercase characters (such as b-i-b a b-i-e and b-i-b b b-i-e no-space ) into uppercase characters (such as b-i-b A b-i-e and b-i-b B b-i-e no-space ). s-n The two phrase names can be the same.
-----

description-for-phrase-copy-from-phrase-to-phrase-initial-caps:
An action that copies the definition of the first phrase into the definition of the second phrase, but changes the first letter of each space hyphen-here delimited word into its equivalent uppercase letter. s-n The remaining letters within the same word are not changed. s-n If the first character after a space is a symbol or digit, that word remains unchanged. s-n If the definition begins with a letter, that letter is converted to uppercase, even though it does not follow a space. s-n The two phrase names can be the same.
-----

description-for-phrase-copy-from-phrase-to-phrase-with-word-order-reversed:
An action that gets the space hyphen-here delimited words in the first phrase, and reverses their order (sequence), and puts those reverse-ordered words into the second phrase. s-n The two phrase names can be the same.
-----

description-for-phrase-copy-from-phrase-to-phrase-words-from-position-to-position:
An action that gets the space hyphen-here delimited words from the first phrase starting at the position indicated by the integer number in the third parameter, and ending at the position indicated by the integer number in the fourth parameter. s-n The word positions are numbered starting at 1 the beginning. s-n If the ending number is greater than the number of words, then the entire remainder of the phrase is retrieved (which means that using a large second number such as 9999 eliminates needing to know how many words are in the phrase). s-n The first two phrase names can be the same.
-----

description-for-phrase-copy-words-from-phrase-to-phrase-using-alpha-sort-order-specified-in-phrase:
An action that gets the space hyphen-here delimited words in the first phrase, and moves those words into the second phrase using the alphabetical sort order specified by the words in the third phrase. s-n As an example, if the first phrase contains the string b-i-b Nikola_Tesla Abe_Lincoln Thomas_Jefferson Benjamin_Franklin b-i-e and the third phrase contains the string b-i-b tesla_nikola jefferson_thomas da_vinci_leonardo maccready_paul b-i-e then the string placed into the second phrase will be b-i-b Leonardo_da_Vinci Thomas_Jefferson Paul_MacCready Nikola_Tesla b-i-e no-space . s-n The first two phrase names can be the same.
-----

description-for-phrase-copy-words-from-phrase-to-phrase-using-numeric-sort-order-specified-in-phrase:
An action that gets the space hyphen-here delimited words in the first phrase, and moves those words into the second phrase using the numeric sort order specified in the third phrase. s-n If numerical sorting is needed, leading zeros (that give every number the same number of digits) must be included in the numbers. s-n As an example, if the first phrase contains the string b-i-b seven one five three twelve b-i-e and the third phrase contains the string b-i-b 7 1 5 3 12 b-i-e then the string placed into the second phrase will be b-i-b one three five seven twelve b-i-e no-space . s-n The first two phrase names can be the same.

Requests that the action b-i-b copy hyphen-here from hyphen-here columns hyphen-here in hyphen-here file hyphen-here to hyphen-here named hyphen-here phrases b-i-e regards two adjacent spaces as the delimiter between words. s-n Without this adjustment that action regards a single space as the delimiter between words. s-n This adjustment enables the text in any column of (text) data to contain single spaces. s-n This adjustment avoids the complications that arise from using a tab character as a column delimiter, such as in exported spreadsheet data.

description-for-phrase-gather-tagged-info-from-file-and-put-unique-values-into-phrase:
Reads from the specified file all the lines in that text file, and creates phrase definitions that are based on the first word in each line. s-n When the first word (of a line) matches the definition of the b-i-b dashrep h-h gather h-h tag h-h begin b-i-e phrase (which has a default value of b-i-b entry_begin b-i-e ), a new set of related items begins, and when the first word (of a line) matches the definition of the b-i-b dashrep h-h gather h-h tag h-h end b-i-e phrase (which has a default value of b-i-b entry_end b-i-e ), that set of items ends. s-n When the first word (of a line) matches the definition of the b-i-b dashrep h-h gather h-h tag h-h unique b-i-e phrase (which has a default value of b-i-b url b-i-e no-space , and which must appear within a set of items), the next (space h-h delimited) word in that line is used as the unique identifier for the items in that set. s-n If the same unique identifier appears in a later set, the items in the new set overwrite the previous items that have the same identifier. s-n Each generated phrase name begins with the tag name (that preceded that item) followed by the string b-i-b h-h value h-h for h-h unique h-h id h-h b-i-e and then followed by the unique value. s-n The list of encountered unique values is put into the second hyphen-here operand phrase. 

paragraph-next

If the string b-i-b multi_line_begin b-i-e immediately follows an item's name, the lines that follow, up to a line that contains (only) b-i-b multi_line_end b-i-e no-space , are combined (with a space between each line's content) into a long value for that named item.

paragraph-next

If a normal (non h-h multi) line begins with the definition of b-i-b dashrep h-h gather h-h tag h-h delete b-i-e phrase (which has a default value of b-i-b delete_id b-i-e ) then the unique value in the second word (of that line) is omitted from the list of encountered unique values. s-n If a later entry specifies a definition for an entry that was requested to be deleted, the later entry overrides the deletion request. s-n A deletion request does not delete any of the already h-h defined phrases, but those phrases will not be accessed if the created phrases are only accessed using the list of encountered unique values.

paragraph-next

This "gather" action is useful for accessing database h-h like text files where the first word in each line acts as the "field" name for a database record, and each set of items corresponds to one database record. s-n This action is also useful for spreadsheet h-h like information where the tag names are analogous to single h-h word column titles, and one row of spreadsheet data is stored in multiple lines, with each cell's content on a separate (labelled) line. s-n The order of the items within each set is not significant, and the order does not need to be the same from one set to another. s-n This action does not require that each set of items use the same first words that are used in other sets, but in that case the generated phrases should be checked for undefined (empty) phrase definitions. s-n The location of the (source) file is specified by the phrase name-of-phrase-that-specifies-read-directory no-space .

description-for-phrase-append-from-phrase-to-phrase:
An action that copies the definition of the first hyphenated phrase onto the end of the definition of the second hyphenated phrase. s-n
This action must be followed by two phrase names, not one. s-n 
Among other uses, this action can be used to build a list of items, or to insert text (such as a raw Dashrep definition) within other text without being translated.
-----

description-for-phrase-repeatedly-append-from-phrase-to-phrase-using-repeat-count:
An action that repeatedly copies the definition of the first hyphenated phrase into the definition of the second hyphenated phrase, until the number of copies specified in the third operand have been inserted. s-n
Spaces separate the copied text strings. s-n
This action must be followed by two phrase names and a positive integer number. s-n 
This action avoids complications that can arise if the text being copied should not be expanded.
-----

description-for-phrase-append-multiple-from-phrases-named-in-pattern-to-phrase:
An action that appends multiple phrase definitions onto the end of the definition of the second phrase. s-n The pattern for the multiple phrase names is specified in the first phrase. s-n The pattern must contain characters between the string b-i-b ambee hyphen-here no-space b-i-e (or b-i-b conambee hyphen-here no-space b-i-e no-space ) and the string b-i-b no-space hyphen-here amenn b-i-e (or b-i-b amenncon hyphen-here no-space b-i-e no-space ) no-space , and these characters must be the name of a phrase that contains the space hyphen-here delimited words that will be inserted at that position within the pattern. s-n If the phrase that contains the word list contains only a string without any spaces (a single word), then only one item will be appended. s-n If the list is empty, nothing will be appended. s-n As an example of this action, if the first phrase contains the string b-i-b item h-h ambee h-h list h-h of h-h numbers h-h as h-h text h-h amenn b-i-e and the phrase b-i-b list h-h of h-h numbers h-h as h-h text b-i-e contains the string b-i-b one two three b-i-e and the second phrase already contains the string b-i-b dolphin b-i-e and the phrase b-i-b item h-h one b-i-e contains b-i-b buffalo b-i-e and the phrase b-i-b item h-h two b-i-e contains b-i-b bear b-i-e and the phrase b-i-b item h-h three b-i-e contains b-i-b eagle b-i-e then the second phrase will contain b-i-b dolphin buffalo bear eagle b-i-e no-space . s-n This action is useful for building a long list fast, without needing to use a separate Dashrep action for each item appended.
-----

description-for-phrase-copy-multiple-words-in-phrase-to-phrases-named-in-pattern:
An action that copies multiple phrase definitions. s-n Specifically space h-h delimited words in the first phrase are copied to multiple phrase names, where the phrase names have the pattern specified in the second phrase. s-n The pattern must contain characters between the string b-i-b ambee hyphen-here no-space b-i-e (or b-i-b conambee hyphen-here no-space b-i-e no-space ) and the string b-i-b no-space hyphen-here amenn b-i-e (or b-i-b amenncon hyphen-here no-space b-i-e no-space ) no-space , and these characters must be the name of a phrase that contains the space hyphen-here delimited words that will be inserted at that position within the pattern. s-n If the phrase that contains the target word list contains only a string without any spaces (a single word), then only one item will be copied. s-n If that list is empty, nothing will be copied. s-n If the number of words in the first phrase is different from the number of words in the list that is specified within the pattern, the copying will stop when the shorter list is exhausted. s-n As an example of this action, if the first phrase contains b-i-b dolphin buffalo bear b-i-e no-space , and the secomd phrase contains b-i-b item h-h ambee h-h list h-h of h-h numbers h-h as h-h text h-h amenn b-i-e no-space , and the phrase b-i-b list h-h of h-h numbers h-h as h-h text b-i-e contains the string b-i-b one two three b-i-e no-space , then the phrase b-i-b item h-h one b-i-e will contain b-i-b dolphin b-i-e and the phrase b-i-b item h-h two b-i-e will contain b-i-b buffalo b-i-e and the phrase b-i-b item h-h three b-i-e will contain b-i-b bear b-i-e no-space. s-n This action is useful for copying a long list fast, without needing to use a separate Dashrep action for each item copied.
-----

description-for-phrase-append-word-to-phrase:
An action that copies the first word onto the end of the definition of the second hyphenated phrase. s-n Do not use this action if the first word might be empty because that causes an error (because the wrong number of operands are supplied).

r-b c-b 3 c-n Space c-n non-breaking-space c-n Each space is significant as a delimiter for hyphenated phrases and words (without hyphens). c-e r-e

r-b c-b 4 c-n Three or more adjacent hyphens c-n b-i-b h-h h-h h-h h-h b-i-e c-n Indicates the end of a definition, in a situation where a hyphenated phrase is defined using the b-i-b dashrep h-h definitions h-h begin b-i-e directive (or the equivalent). c-e r-e

r-b c-b 5 c-n Parameter c-n b-i-b [ h-h b-i-e non-breaking-space parameter non-breaking-space b-i-b h-h ] b-i-e c-n A parameter is expanded before the surrounding text is expanded. s-n The first-encountered innermost parameter is expanded first. s-n Spaces at the beginning and end of the parameter are removed, which allows the expanded text to become part of a hyphenated phrase, which in turn enables branching and indexing. c-e r-e

r-b c-b 6 c-n Assignment c-n b-i-b [ h-h b-i-e user-phrase-name b-i-b = b-i-e new text b-i-b h-h ] b-i-e c-n If a parameter contains an equal sign (=) and there is one hyphenated phrase between the equal sign and the beginning of the parameter, the text to the right of the equal sign (up to the end of the parameter) is assigned as the definition of the phrase. s-n If the hyphenated phrase already had a definition, that definition is discarded. s-n If the text between the beginning of a parameter and an equal sign is not one hyphenated phrase, the equal sign is not recognized as being part of an assignment. s-n The assignment capability enables the same phrase to produce different results, which is what a "function" does in traditional programming languages. c-e r-e

r-b c-b 5 c-n Phrase name in parameter brackets c-n b-i-b [ h-h b-i-e user h-h phrase h-h name b-i-b h-h ] b-i-e c-n A hyphenated phrase within parameter brackets is expanded according to the phrase's definition (which itself can contain parameters). s-n If the phrase name is not defined, it is left as-is, and the parameter brackets are removed. s-n Spaces at the beginning and end of the parameter are removed, which allows the expanded text to become part of a hyphenated phrase, which in turn enables branching and indexing. c-e r-e

r-b c-b 7 c-n Action c-n b-i-b [ h-h b-i-e zero h-h one h-h multiple 3 b-i-b h-h ] b-i-e c-n If the first (left-most) hyphenated phrase inside a parameter is one of the recognized actions (listed below), and the action is followed by text that the action knows how to handle, the action is performed. s-n Some actions produce text that becomes the replacement for the parameter, whereas other actions operate on phrases or files and do not produce any text. c-e r-e

r-b c-b 8 c-n Hyphenated phrase c-n needed h-h text h-h string c-n A hyphen surrounded by non-space characters (and also excluding square brackets) is recognized as a hyphenated phrase. s-n (A hyphen and a dash are different names for the same symbol.) s-n A phrase name is case-sensitive. s-n Lowercase-only names are recommended, but not required. s-n Speakable names are recommended, but not required. s-n The use of nouns before, rather than after, adjectives is recommended; this convention (for example b-i-b rectangle h-h large h-h begin b-i-e instead of b-i-b large h-h rectangle h-h begin b-i-e no-space ) is typical of many spoken languages, but not English.  s-n The first character cannot be a hyphen and cannot be a digit. s-n The last character cannot be a hyphen. c-e r-e

r-b c-b 10 c-n New line or line break c-n one line b-i-b line-break b-i-e next line c-n When a new line begins, it is replaced with a space. s-n When a new line needs to be inserted into the resulting text, the new h-h line phrase (explained below) can be used. s-n If a line break in the target language (such as HTML) is needed, the phrase line h-h break can be used to insert the appropriate target-specific code (which in HTML is the b-i-b <br \> b-i-e tag). c-e r-e

r-b c-b 11 c-n Undefined hyphenated phrase c-n quite-talkative parrot c-n If a hyphenated phrase has not been defined, it is not translated; it remains unchanged. s-n If a hyphenated phrase has been defined and is now empty, the hyphenated phrase will disapper. c-e r-e
