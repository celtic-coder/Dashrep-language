description-for-phrase-dashrep-definition-append-next:
This directive requests that the next definition be appended to the existing definition of the specified phrase. s-n This directive allows a list to be created during the reading of definitions because it overrides the normal convention of replacing the existing definition (when the same phrase name is defined more than once).
-----

description-for-phrase-delayed-nospace:
This phrase is not defined, but this name is reserved for use as a placeholder where the phrase b-i-b no h-h space b-i-e needs to be inserted later, after other replacements have been done. s-n When ready, this phrase should be defined as b-i-b no h-h space b-i-e just before the final translation step.
-----

description-for-phrase-delayed-newline:
This phrase is not defined, but this name is reserved for use as a placeholder where the phrase b-i-b new h-h line b-i-e needs to be inserted later, after other replacements have been done. s-n When ready, this phrase should be defined as b-i-b new h-h line b-i-e just before the final translation step.
-----

description-for-phrase-character-close-square-bracket:
This pre h-h defined phrase contains the close h-h square h-h bracket character ( no-space b-b ] b-e no-space ).
-----

description-for-phrase-character-hyphen:
This pre h-h defined phrase contains one hyphen character
( no-space
b-i-b h-h b-i-e
no-space ).
-----

description-for-phrase-character-newline:
This pre h-h defined phrase contains a newline character. s-n
In some other programming languages this character is represented by the text
bold-begin \ no-space italics-begin n b-i-e
no-space .
-----

description-for-phrase-character-open-square-bracket:
This pre h-h defined phrase contains the open h-h square h-h bracket character ( no-space b-b [ b-e no-space ).
-----

description-for-phrase-character-space:
This pre h-h defined phrase contains one space character.
-----

description-for-phrase-character-tab:
This pre h-h defined phrase contains a tab character. s-n
In some other programming languages this character is represented by the text
bold-begin \ no-space italics-begin t b-i-e
no-space .
-----

description-for-phrase-get-characters-from-position-to-position:
This action gets the characters from the specified phrase starting at the position indicated by the first number, and ending at the position indicated by the second number. s-n The character positions are numbered starting with 1 at the first character position. s-n If the second number is greater than the number of characters, then the entire remainder of the phrase is retrieved (which means that using a large second number such as 9999 eliminates needing to know how many characters are in the phrase).
-----

description-for-phrase-clear-all-expanded-text-up-to-here:
This action removes all the expanded text up to this action. s-n It is useful when earlier actions might have failed to recognize some phrase names and left those phrase names in the text being expanded.
-----

description-for-phrase-copy-words-sort-alphabetic:
This action gets the space hyphen-here delimited words in the first phrase, and sorts those words alphabetically, and puts those sorted words into the second phrase. s-n The two phrase names can be the same.
-----

description-for-phrase-encode-as-cgi-parameter:
This action converts symbols and other non hyphen-here alphabetic and non hyphen-here digit characters into the special format that allows the text to be passed to a web server as a CGI parameter. s-n As an example, a comma is represented as b-b %2c b-e no-space . s-n The two phrase names can be the same.
-----

description-for-phrase-decode-from-cgi-parameter:
This action converts a CGI parameter into normal (non h-h encoded) characters. sentence-next This action is the inverse of the b-i-b copy h-h from h-h phrase h-h to h-h phrase h-h and h-h encode h-h as h-h cgi h-h parameter b-i-e action. s-n As an example, the text b-b %2c b-e is converted into a space character. s-n The two phrase names can be the same.
-----

description-for-phrase-copy-without-extra-spaces:
This action removes multiple adjacent spaces so that only single spaces occur, and removes all spaces at the beginning and end of the text. s-n The first phrase specifies the source text, and the second phrase specifies the destination. s-n The two phrase names can be the same.
-----

description-for-phrase-undeleted-phrase:
See the action b-i-b delete h-h all h-h dashrep h-h phrases b-i-e for details.
-----

description-for-phrase-copy-and-remove-attributes-from-xml-tags:
This action removes attributes from XML and HTML tags, and also removes RSS h-h style b-i-b CDATA b-i-e strings. s-n The first phrase specifies the source text, and the second phrase specifies the destination. s-n The two phrase names can be the same.
paragraph-next
Example: If the specified phrase contains b-i-b and a &lt;span style="whatever"&gt;dolphin&lt;/span&gt; b-i-e no-space , the result is b-i-b and a &lt;span&gt;dolphin&lt;/span&gt; b-i-e no-space .
paragraph-next
The change assumes that none of the tag's attributes contain a close angle bracket ( no-space b-i-b &gt; b-i-e no-space ). s-n The result is not intended to be valid XML or HTML or RSS code. s-n Instead the intended purpose is to simplify the text as preparation for further manipulations.
-----

description-for-phrase-copy-and-replace:
This action replaces each occurrence of the third phrase with the text in the fourth phrase, based on the text in the first phrase, and places the result into the second phrase. s-n If the replacement phrase contains the search phrase, nothing is changed, and a warning is put into the trace information because that could cause an endless loop. s-n The special phrases b-i-b character hyphen-here space b-i-e and b-i-b character hyphen-here hyphen b-i-e and b-i-b character hyphen-here newline b-i-e are useful here (because the language does not have ways to define those characters). s-n The first two phrase names can be the same.
-----

description-for-phrase-copy-characters-from-position-to-position:
This action copies specified characters from the first phrase to the second phrase. s-n The third and fourth operands indicate the starting and ending character positions, with the first character position being numbered one (1). s-n The starting character position must not be larger than the ending character position. s-n The first two phrase names can be the same.
-----

description-for-phrase-copy-lowercase-only:
This action copies the definition of the first phrase into the definition of the second phrase, but changes any uppercase characters (such as b-i-b A b-i-e and b-i-b B b-i-e no-space ) into lowercase characters (such as b-i-b a b-i-e and b-i-b b b-i-e no-space ). s-n The two phrase names can be the same.
----

description-for-phrase-copy-uppercase-only:
This action copies the definition of the first phrase into the definition of the second phrase, but changes any lowercase characters (such as b-i-b a b-i-e and b-i-b b b-i-e no-space ) into uppercase characters (such as b-i-b A b-i-e and b-i-b B b-i-e no-space ). s-n The two phrase names can be the same.
-----

description-for-phrase-copy-initial-caps:
This action copies the definition of the first phrase into the definition of the second phrase, but changes the first letter of each space hyphen-here delimited word into its equivalent uppercase letter. s-n The remaining letters within the same word are not changed. s-n If the first character after a space is a symbol or digit, that word remains unchanged. s-n If the definition begins with a letter, that letter is converted to uppercase, even though it does not follow a space. s-n The two phrase names can be the same.
-----

description-for-phrase-copy-words-order-reversed:
This action gets the space hyphen-here delimited words in the first phrase, and reverses their order (sequence), and puts those reverse-ordered words into the second phrase. s-n The two phrase names can be the same.
paragraph-next
Example: If the first phrase contains b-i-b dolphin whale octopus b-i-e then the second phrase will contain b-i-b octopus whale dolphin b-i-e no-space .
-----

description-for-phrase-copy-words-from-position-to-position:
This action gets the space hyphen-here delimited words from the first phrase starting at the position indicated by the integer number in the third parameter, and ending at the position indicated by the integer number in the fourth parameter. s-n The word positions are numbered starting with 1 at the beginning. s-n If the ending number is greater than the number of words, then the entire remainder of the phrase is retrieved (which means that using a large second number such as 9999 eliminates needing to know how many words are in the phrase). s-n The first two phrase names can be the same.
-----

description-for-phrase-copy-words-at-skip-interval:
This action copies some space hyphen-here delimited words from the first phrase to the second phrase using the skip interval specified by the integer number in the third phrase. s-n The first word is always copied, unless the first phrase is empty. s-n The skip interval is the distance between copied words. s-n The word positions are numbered starting with 1 at the beginning. s-n The first two phrase names can be the same.
paragraph-next
Example: If the first phrase contains b-i-b 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 b-i-e and the third phrase contains b-i-b 2 b-i-e then the second phrase will contain b-i-b 1 3 5 7 b-i-e no-space .
-----

description-for-phrase-copy-words-rearrange-using-order-sort-alphabetic:
This action gets the space hyphen-here delimited words in the first phrase, and moves those words into the second phrase using the alphabetical sort order specified by the words in the third phrase. s-n The first two phrase names can be the same.
paragraph-next
Example: If the first phrase contains the text b-i-b Nikola_Tesla Abe_Lincoln Thomas_Jefferson Paul_MacCready b-i-e and the third phrase contains the text b-i-b tesla_nikola jefferson_thomas da_vinci_leonardo maccready_paul b-i-e then the text placed into the second phrase will be b-i-b Leonardo_da_Vinci Thomas_Jefferson Paul_MacCready Nikola_Tesla b-i-e no-space .
-----

description-for-phrase-copy-words-rearrange-using-order-sort-numeric:
This action gets the space hyphen-here delimited words in the first phrase, and moves those words into the second phrase using the numeric sort order specified in the third phrase. s-n The first two phrase names can be the same.
paragraph-next
Example: If the first phrase contains the text b-i-b seven one five three twelve b-i-e and the third phrase contains the text b-i-b 7 1 5 3 12 b-i-e then the text placed into the second phrase will be b-i-b one three five seven twelve b-i-e no-space .
-----

description-for-phrase-get-count-of-characters:
This action counts the number of characters in the definition that is associated with the specified phrase, and supplies the number as its result. s-n Spaces and non-visible characters (such as the newline character) are included in the count.
-----

description-for-phrase-copy-words-that-begin-with-text:
This action looks at all the words in the first phrase and identifies the words that begin with the text in the third phrase, and puts those partially (or fully) matching words into the second phrase, with a space between each phrase name.
paragraph-next
Example: If the first phrase contains b-i-b honeybees bees honey hives beehives b-i-e and the third phrase contains b-i-b bee b-i-e then the second phrase will contain b-i-b bees beehives b-i-e no-space .
-----

-----

description-for-phrase-dashrep-action-trace-on-yes-or-no:
If this phrase equals b-i-b yes b-i-e then each encountered action adds a message to the trace log to indicate which action occurred. s-n Any other value causes silence when each encountered action is handled. s-n For some actions, additional information about the action is included.
-----

description-for-phrase-dashrep-debug-trace-on-yes-or-no:
If this phrase equals b-i-b yes b-i-e then trace messages are added to the trace log. s-n Any other value causes silence when a trace message would otherwise be written.
-----

description-for-phrase-trace-show:
This action displays the definition of the specified phrase in the trace log. s-n These requests are highlighted with multiple asterisks ( no-space b-i-b ******* b-i-e no-space ). s-n The requested information appears in the trace log regardless of whether the b-i-b dashrep h-h action h-h trace h-h on h-h yes h-h or h-h no b-i-e definition is b-i-b yes b-i-e or b-i-b no b-i-e no-space .
-----

-----

description-for-phrase-end-of-line-here:
This phrase contains text that is inserted at the end of each line when the action
b-i-b copy-from-file-to-phrase b-i-e is used, and if the phrase b-i-b dashrep h-h yes h-h indicate h-h line h-h endings b-i-e equals b-i-b yes b-i-e no-space .
-----

description-for-phrase-generate-every-ordered-pairwise-combination-of-words:
This action generates two word-based lists that are named according to the third phrase and the fourth phrase, where each pair of words is one possible b-b ordered b-e combination of words listed in the first phrase and the second phrase.
paragraph-next
Example: If the first phrase contains b-i-b dolphin eagle bear b-i-e and the second phrase contains b-i-b leaps flies ambles b-i-e then the third phrase will contain b-i-b
dolphin eagle bear eagle bear bear

description-for-phrase-if-yes-begin:
This action looks at the first space hyphen-here delimited word, and if it is b-i-b yes b-i-e (or contains that word) then this action removes all the text between the next occurrences of b-i-b [ hyphen-here if hyphen-here else hyphen-here ] b-i-e and b-i-b [ hyphen-here if hyphen-here end hyphen-here ] b-i-e (and removes the b-i-b [ hyphen-here if hyphen-here else hyphen-here ] b-i-e and b-i-b [ hyphen-here if hyphen-here end hyphen-here ] b-i-e text items). sentence-next Otherwise (if the first word that follows does not contain b-i-b yes b-i-e no-space ) then this action removes all the text between itself (the action name) and the next occurrence of b-i-b [ hyphen-here if hyphen-here else hyphen-here ] b-i-e (and removes the b-i-b [ hyphen-here if hyphen-here else hyphen-here ] b-i-e and b-i-b [ hyphen-here if hyphen-here end hyphen-here ] b-i-e text items). sentence-next This action provides a major branching capability. sentence-next However, the action b-i-b if hyphen-here yes hyphen-here begin b-i-e and the text b-i-b [ hyphen-here if hyphen-here else hyphen-here ] b-i-e and the text b-i-b [ hyphen-here if hyphen-here end hyphen-here ] b-i-e b-b cannot b-e be nested (as allowed in most programming languages). sentence-next Specifically, an inner b-i-b if b-i-e action must not appear within an outer b-i-b if b-i-e action within the same Dashrep code. s-n The functional nesting of b-i-b if b-i-e branches is allowed if the inner b-i-b if b-i-e action appears within a separate phrase that is not expanded until after the outer b-i-b if b-i-e directive is handled.
-----

description-for-phrase-if-no-begin:
This action works similar to the action b-i-b if hyphen-here yes hyphen-here begin b-i-e except that the word b-i-b no b-i-e is used instead of the word b-i-b yes b-i-e no-space .
-----

description-for-phrase-if-else:
This special text is recognized by the action b-i-b if hyphen-here yes hyphen-here begin b-i-e and the action b-i-b if hyphen-here no hyphen-here begin b-i-e no-space . sentence-next It must be enclosed by parameter brackets in order to be recognized.
-----

description-for-phrase-if-end:
This special text is recognized by the action b-i-b if hyphen-here yes hyphen-here begin b-i-e and the action b-i-b if hyphen-here no hyphen-here begin b-i-e no-space . sentence-next It must be enclosed by parameter brackets in order to be recognized.
-----

description-for-phrase-if-first-word-is-no-then-keep-remainder-else-empty:
This action looks at the first space hyphen-here delimited word, and if it is b-i-b no b-i-e then this action supplies all the text that remains within the parameter brackets. sentence-next If the first word that follows is not b-i-b no b-i-e no-space , then no text is supplied. sentence-next When used at or near the end of a phrase, this action can provide a major branching capability.
-----

description-for-phrase-if-first-word-is-yes-then-keep-remainder-else-empty:
This action looks at the first space hyphen-here delimited word, and if it is b-i-b yes b-i-e then this action supplies all the text that remains within the parameter brackets. sentence-next If the first word that follows is not b-i-b yes b-i-e no-space , then no text is supplied. sentence-next When used at or near the end of a phrase, this action can provide a major branching capability.
-----

description-for-phrase-linewise-input-line-count:
See the description for b-i-b linewise h-h read h-h from h-h file h-h and h-h use h-h handler b-i-e no-space .
-----

description-for-phrase-insert-angle-bracketed-definitions:
This action modifies the specified phrase by replacing each occurrence of a specially identified hyphenated phrase with the definition of that phrase. s-n The specially identified hyphenated phrases begin and end with angle brackets ( no-space b-i-b &lt; b-i-e and b-i-b &gt; b-i-e no-space ) and contain at least one underscore ( no-space b-i-b _ b-i-e no-space ), such as b-i-b &lt;special_content&gt; b-i-e no-space . s-n For each such specially identified hyphenated phrase, the underscores are replaced with hyphens, and if the resulting hyphenated phrase has a definition, then that definition is inserted in place of the specially identified hyphenated phrase. s-n The special text b-i-b &lt;character_hyphen&gt; b-i-e is replaced by a hyphen ( no-space b-i-b - b-i-e no-space ) and is especially useful for handling text that contains Dashrep phrases that must not be replaced. s-n The special text items b-i-b &lt;no_space&gt; b-i-e and b-i-b &lt;new_line&gt; b-i-e provide functionality that is equivalent to the b-i-b no h-h space b-i-e and b-i-b new h-h line b-i-e directives.
-----

description-for-phrase-linewise-read-from-file-and-use-handler:
This action reads each and every line from the text file whose name is specified by the first phrase, and that expands the handler specified by the second phrase. s-n When the handler phrase is expanded, the contents of the current line is available in the phrase named b-i-b storage h-h input h-h line h-h from h-h file b-i-e no-space , and the current line number (starting at one for the first line in the file) is available in the phrase named b-i-b linewise h-h input h-h line h-h count b-i-e no-space . s-n

description-for-phrase-numeric-absolute:
This action calculates the absolute value of the number that follows, and supplies the result.
-----

description-for-phrase-numeric-add:
This action adds the numbers that follow, and supplies the result. s-n The numbers can be positive or negative integers, or they can be positive or negative decimal numbers, but floating-point numbers are not recognized. s-n As applies to all Dashrep numeric calculations, each calculation converts the text h-h based digits into binary values, and the result is converted back into text-based digits, so the calculations are slow compared to the speed of most programming languages. s-n If more than a few simple calculations are being done, consider doing the intensive numerical processing in a different programming language.
----

description-for-phrase-numeric-cosine:
This action calculates the (trigonometric) cosine of the number that follows, and supplies the result.
-----

description-for-phrase-numeric-divide-by:
This action divides the first number by the second number, and supplies the result. s-n See b-i-b numeric h-h add b-i-e for additional information.
-----

description-for-phrase-numeric-equal-greater-less-compare:
This action supplies the word b-i-b equal b-i-e if the two numbers that follow are numerically equal, or supplies the word b-i-b greater b-i-e if the first number is greater than the second number, or supplies the word b-i-b less b-i-e if the first number is less than the second number. 
-----

description-for-phrase-numeric-integer:
This action calculates the integer value of a real number, and supplies the result. s-n If an integer is supplied, the same integer is returned (although leading zeros, if present, are removed).
-----

description-for-phrase-numeric-vector-add-number:
This action adds a single number to each number in the supplied vector and produces a vector sum. s-n Each vector is a space h-h delimited list of numbers. s-n The vector in the definition of the first operand is added to the single number that is supplied as the second operand. s-n The resulting vector is put into the definition of the third operand. s-n The numbers can be positive or negative integers, or they can be positive or negative decimal numbers, but floating-point numbers are not recognized. s-n If subtraction is needed, either insert a minus sign in front of a positive integer, or multiply the single number times minus one before using it in this action. s-n As applies to all Dashrep numeric calculations, each calculation converts the text h-h based digits into binary values, and the result is converted back into text-based digits, so the calculations are slow compared to the speed of most programming languages.
----

description-for-phrase-numeric-vector-multiply-by-number:
This action multiplies a vector times a single number and produces a resulting vector. s-n Each vector is a space h-h delimited list of numbers. s-n The vector in the definition of the first operand is multiplied by the second operand, and the resulting vector is put into the definition of the third operand. s-n The numbers can be positive or negative integers, or they can be positive or negative decimal numbers, but floating-point numbers are not recognized. s-n As applies to all Dashrep numeric calculations, each calculation converts the text h-h based digits into binary values, and the result is converted back into text-based digits, so the calculations are slow compared to the speed of most programming languages.
----

description-for-phrase-numeric-vector-integers:
This action converts into integers the real numbers that are supplied in the vector that is named in the first operand. s-n The vector is a space h-h delimited list of numbers, which can include integers as well as real numbers. s-n The resulting vector is put into the definition of the second operand. s-n Floating-point numbers are not recognized.
----

description-for-phrase-numeric-vector-absolutes:
This action converts a list of numbers within a vector into their absolute values, and puts the resulting list into the definition of the second operand. s-n The vector is a space h-h delimited list of numbers, which can include integers as well as real numbers. s-n Floating-point numbers are not recognized.

If a normal (non h-h multi) line begins with the definition of the b-i-b dashrep h-h gather h-h tag h-h delete b-i-e phrase (which has a default value of b-i-b delete_id b-i-e ) then the unique value in the second word (of that line) is omitted from the list of encountered unique values. s-n If a later entry specifies a definition for an entry that was requested to be deleted, the later entry overrides the deletion request. s-n A deletion request does not delete any of the already h-h defined phrases, but those phrases will not be accessed if the created phrases are only accessed using the list of encountered unique values. s-n As an example, an entry with the unique ID of b-i-b 1776 b-i-e can be deleted by appending (to the file) the line b-i-b delete_id 1776 b-i-e no-space .

paragraph-next

A list of the encountered tag names is put into the phrase b-i-b dashrep h-h gathered h-h tag h-h names b-i-e no-space . s-n The order of the list is the order in which the tag names were first encountered.

paragraph-next

This "gather" action is useful for accessing database h-h like text files where the first word in each line acts as the "field" name for a database record, and each set of items corresponds to one database record. s-n This action is also useful for spreadsheet h-h like information where the tag names are analogous to single h-h word column titles, and one row of spreadsheet data is stored in multiple lines, with each cell's content on a separate (labelled) line. s-n The order of the items within each set is not significant, and the order does not need to be the same from one set to another. s-n This action does not require that each set of items use the same first words that are used in other sets, but in that case the generated phrases should be checked for undefined (empty) phrase definitions.

This action copies from the definition of the first phrase all the words that appear in that definition, but without repeating any words that are repeated in the definition. s-n The position of the first occurrence of a word determines the position of that word in the result list. s-n In addition, the special phrase b-i-b list h-h of h-h unique h-h word h-h counts b-i-e contains a list of counts that indicate how many times each word (in the result list) occurs in the original list. s-n In addition, the special phrase b-i-b list h-h of h-h pointers h-h to h-h unique h-h words b-i-e contains a list of pointers to the space h-h delimited words in the original list, and these pointers are in the same sequence as the result list, but without including any positions of words that are duplicate words. s-n The pointer list is useful when the original list is in the same sequence as other lists that contain other information about the same items, and a specific number of unique items at the beginning of the result list need to be identified in a way that does not lose the association between the unique items and the other information in the other lists.
paragraph-next
Example: If the first phrase definition is b-i-b dolphin whale whale starfish dolphin b-i-e then the second phrase is defined as b-i-b dolphin whale starfish b-i-e no-space . s-n In addition, the phrase b-i-b list h-h of h-h unique h-h word h-h counts b-i-e contains b-i-b 2 2 1 b-i-e no-space . s-n In addition, the phrase b-i-b list h-h of h-h pointers h-h to h-h unique h-h words b-i-e contains b-i-b 1 2 4 b-i-e no-space .
----

description-for-phrase-list-of-unique-word-counts:
This phrase contains a list of word counts for the unique words found by the most recent use of the action b-i-b copy h-h words h-h unique h-h only b-i-e no-space . s-n If that action has not yet been used, this phrase is empty. s-n See b-i-b copy h-h words h-h unique h-h only b-i-e for details.
----

description-for-phrase-list-of-pointers-to-unique-words:
This phrase contains a list of word pointers for the unique words found by the most recent use of the action b-i-b copy h-h words h-h unique h-h only b-i-e no-space . s-n If that action has not yet been used, this phrase is empty. s-n See b-i-b copy h-h words h-h unique h-h only b-i-e for details.
----

description-for-phrase-generate-counts-from-integer-to-integer:
This action generates a list of integers and puts them into the definition of the third phrase. s-n The supplied integers indicate the starting and ending values.
paragraph-next
Example: b-i-b [-generate h-h counts h-h from h-h integer h-h to h-h integer 1 10 one h-h to h-h ten-] b-i-e defines the phrase b-i-b one h-h to h-h ten b-i-e as b-i-b 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 b-i-e no-space .
----

description-for-phrase-every-combination-of-words-from-two-phrases-put-into-two-phrases:
This action generates two lists of words and puts them into the definitions of the third and fourth phrases. s-n Every possible combination of two words is generated, with the first two phrases supplying the lists of words.
paragraph-next
Example: If the first phrase contains b-i-b h-h no-space 2 h-h no-space 1 0 1 2 b-i-e and the second phrase contains b-i-b 12 17 32 55 b-i-e then the third phrase will contain b-i-b h-h 2 one-space h-h 2 one-space h-h 2 one-space h-h 2 one-space h-h 1 one-space h-h 1 one-space h-h 1 one-space h-h 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 b-i-e and the fourth phrase will contain b-i-b 12 17 32 55 12 17 32 55 12 17 32 55 12 17 32 55 12 17 32 55 b-i-e . s-n (The words do not have to be numbers.)
----

description-for-phrase-delete-all-dashrep-phrases:
This action deletes all the definitions of all the phrases. s-n Specifically, this action resets (undefines) every definition of every phrase, except the phrases that are defined internally. s-n If the phrase b-i-b undeleted h-h phrase b-i-e exists and contains at least one non h-h space character, the contents of this special phrase is restored after all the phrases have been deleted. s-n The phrase b-i-b undeleted h-h phrase b-i-e is useful for holding instructions that need to be executed after this action has deleted all other phrases.
----

description-for-phrase-dashrep-comments-ignored:
This phrase contains text that the translation process has identified as comments. s-n Comments are contained within the text b-i-b * no-space h-h h-h h-h no-space b-i-e and b-i-b no-space h-h h-h h-h no-space * b-i-e no-space , but these delimiters cannot be nested, so this definition can be useful for debugging.
----

description-for-phrase-insert-codeview-tags:
This action inserts into the specified phrase definition special tags that enable the raw Dashrep code to be displayed, such as on a web page. s-n The special inserted tags, such as b-i-b &lt;dashrep_codeview_action_begin&gt; b-i-e and b-i-b &lt;dashrep_codeview_action_middle_1&gt; b-i-e no-space , are expected to be replaced by the text items in phrases such as b-i-b dashrep-codeview-action-begin b-i-e and b-i-b dashrep-codeview-action-middle-1 b-i-e no-space .

r-b c-b 1 c-n Comment c-n b-i-b / h-h h-h h-h non-breaking-space b-i-e comment here non-breaking-space b-i-b h-h h-h h-h / b-i-e c-n Alternate written way to indicate a comment. c-e r-e

r-b c-b 2 c-n Comment c-n b-i-b comment h-h begin b-i-e comment here b-i-b comment h-h end b-i-e c-n An alternate way &mdash; that is speakable &mdash; to insert a comment. s-n The b-i-b comment h-h begin b-i-e phrase indicates the beginning of a comment, and the b-i-b comment h-h end b-i-e phrase indicates the end of the comment. s-n Comments cannot be nested. c-e r-e

r-b c-b 3 c-n Space c-n non-breaking-space c-n Each space is significant as a delimiter for hyphenated phrases and words (without hyphens). c-e r-e

r-b c-b 4 c-n Three or more adjacent hyphens c-n b-i-b h-h h-h h-h h-h b-i-e c-n Indicates the end of a definition, in a situation where a hyphenated phrase is defined using the b-i-b dashrep h-h definitions h-h begin b-i-e directive (or the equivalent). c-e r-e

r-b c-b 5 c-n Parameter c-n b-i-b [ h-h b-i-e non-breaking-space parameter non-breaking-space b-i-b h-h ] b-i-e c-n A parameter is expanded before the surrounding text is expanded. s-n The first-encountered innermost parameter is expanded first. s-n Spaces at the beginning and end of the parameter are removed, which allows the expanded text to become part of a hyphenated phrase, which in turn enables branching and indexing. c-e r-e

r-b c-b 5 c-n Phrase name in parameter brackets c-n b-i-b [ h-h b-i-e user h-h phrase h-h name b-i-b h-h ] b-i-e c-n A hyphenated phrase within parameter brackets is expanded according to the phrase's definition (which itself can contain parameters). s-n If the phrase name is not defined, it is left as-is, and the parameter brackets are removed. s-n Spaces at the beginning and end of the parameter are removed, which allows the expanded text to become part of a hyphenated phrase, which in turn enables branching and indexing. c-e r-e

r-b c-b 6 c-n Action c-n b-i-b [ h-h b-i-e zero h-h one h-h multiple 3 b-i-b h-h ] b-i-e c-n If the first (left-most) hyphenated phrase inside a parameter is one of the recognized actions (listed below), and the action is followed by text that the action knows how to handle, the action is performed. s-n Some actions produce text that becomes the replacement for the parameter, whereas other actions operate on phrases or files and do not produce any text. c-e r-e

r-b c-b 7 c-n Hyphenated phrase c-n needed h-h text h-h string c-n A hyphen surrounded by non-space characters (and also excluding square brackets) is recognized as a hyphenated phrase. s-n (A hyphen and a dash are different names for the same symbol.) s-n A phrase name is case-sensitive. s-n Lowercase-only names are recommended, but not required. s-n Speakable names are recommended, but not required. s-n The use of nouns before, rather than after, adjectives is recommended; this convention (for example b-i-b rectangle h-h large h-h begin b-i-e instead of b-i-b large h-h rectangle h-h begin b-i-e no-space ) is typical of many spoken languages, but not English.  s-n The first character cannot be a hyphen and cannot be a digit. s-n The last character cannot be a hyphen. c-e r-e

r-b c-b 8 c-n Colon c-n needed h-h text h-h string no-space b-i-b : b-i-e definition here non-breaking-space b-i-b h-h h-h h-h h-h b-i-e c-n When there is text after the b-i-b dashrep h-h definitions h-h begin b-i-e directive, a colon can appear at the end of the phrase being defined. s-n This convention is optional. s-n It offers the advantage of making it easier to search for where a hyphenated phrase is defined, without also finding each place it is used. c-e r-e

r-b c-b 9 c-n New line or line break c-n one line b-i-b line-break b-i-e next line c-n When a new line begins, it is replaced with a space. s-n When a new line needs to be inserted into the resulting text, the new h-h line phrase (explained below) can be used. s-n If a line break in the target language (such as HTML) is needed, the phrase line h-h break can be used to insert the appropriate target-specific code (which in HTML is the b-i-b <br \> b-i-e tag). c-e r-e

r-b c-b 10 c-n Undefined hyphenated phrase c-n quite-talkative parrot c-n If a hyphenated phrase has not been defined, it is not translated; it remains unchanged. s-n If a hyphenated phrase has been defined and is now empty, the hyphenated phrase will disapper. c-e r-e

r-b c-b 11 c-n define h-h begin c-n b-i-b define h-h begin b-i-e c-n Explained below. c-e r-e

r-b c-b 12 c-n dashrep h-h definitions h-h begin c-n b-i-b dashrep h-h definitions h-h begin b-i-e c-n Explained below. c-e r-e
